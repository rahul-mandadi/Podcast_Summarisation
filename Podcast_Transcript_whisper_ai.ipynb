When I first met him, it was like one of those weird things where, you know, I mean, you've a lot of famous people some of them you meet him you're like Some people just just not talk they should only do what they do act and sing But then you get to know them like I don't like, I'm pretty good at this now where you don't, where you see people that you, like, looked up to. Like, Eddie Vedder, I had a pretty close relationship with Eddie Vedder. Oh, really? Yeah, but I was drinking and then I would grab his balls and do shit like that. And then it was like, I don't want him around. I don't want Josh around. Yeah. I don't like that anymore. I don't want my, you know, and I think Sean Penn appreciated shit like that. Like, wow, somebody has the balls. It's not even a little chaos. It's like somebody has the balls to like call me on my shit. Like not everybody's afraid of me. Oh, right. Yeah. He's probably used to people constantly being afraid of him. Like, oh, I can't fuck with him. Right. Well, he does wild shit. Like, when he went down to fucking Mexico and met with El Chapo, like, Jesus Christ, dude. That's a fucking wild, reckless thing to do. And I do think that that's organic, but I think that that's also, you just have that thing where you just go, you know what? Shit's getting boring. Right. The weather's just too fucking nice here. Weather's too nice. I'm too famous. Let's go meet a mobster. Yeah. Let's go fuck some shit up. Let's do something. Let's do something big. Let's do something really reckless. Let's do something that's going to resonate for at least a year. Yeah. That whole El Chapo thing was so crazy, though, because that kind of is one of the things that got him caught. It was, right? Yeah. Yeah, because they track your cell phone data. Yeah. They know where you go. And if you're bringing your fucking cell phone, you're basically bringing a tracking device to go find one of the most notorious gangsters alive today. The most notorious? I mean, who was the guy with the football team back in the day? Pablo Escobar? Think about it. It's our days. This time it's Pablo Escobar. Yeah.. Sean Penn. Golden hangs out with him. Spicoli. Because, you know what, man? Spicoli. Hey, who wants to come with me and find this motherfucker? Did he go solo? I think so. I think he went solo. Well, he knew that lady who was like a reporter. You know, there was like this really hot Mexican reporter. Oh, yeah, the Mexican girl. Yeah. Yeah, he knew her. Was he dating her? I don enjoyed it. God, that was the connect. And El Chapo's like, I like the meat. It's piccoli. Yeah, I like the meat. I love you. Yeah, I really enjoyed you in colors. And then next thing you know. What's the most dangerous thing that you do now? What do you think? Dangerous thing? Yeah, like we're talking about Sean going out on a limb. Do you find it necessary to go out and do things that challenge you in a way? Yes. Challenge your psyche? Yes. In what way? Elk hunting's probably the most exciting. What is? Elk hunting. Elk hunting. Why? Because it puts you in danger? Well, no. It's just really difficult. You know, you're bow hunting in the mountains. Right. And it's just you in the mountains and just fucking mountain lions and bears and shit. Do you stay up there for days and days and days and do you quarter your kill? Oh yeah, we pack it out, yeah. See, that's a different thing. Yeah. You know, people say, I don't like hunting. Personally, I grew up in a very red part of California. Everybody hunts that I grew up with. And I would shoot and I would hunt with my dad and I would like fucking think about it and dream about it for three weeks. Oh yeah, I love it. I love it. I love eating it. No, no, no. I'm saying that I would like spiral. Oh, you'd get negative with it. Not even, it was negative. Yeah, I guess it would be negative, but it would like made me think of like the kids that were going like, mom, mom, are you there? And I just killed the mother. It's like the Bambi kind of thing. Right. But I eat meat. So that hypocritical thing of like, I don't want to kill anything, but I want you to kill it for me so I can eat it because I really like the way it tastes. Well, that's the anthropomorphization of animals that Disney has kind of done a number on people with, you know, like Bambi and Yogi Bear and all that kind of shit, cartoons and teddy bears. And we have a very, you know, living in, when you live in urban areas and cities and people, you know, streets and concrete and people just get a very distorted idea of nature and our relationship with nature. And when you're a kid and you're just, these are sweet, cute things. And then all of a sudden you're supposed to go murder one. Like, it's all fucked up. But what's fucked up is the cartoons. I mean, they're cute and everything. Because they depict it in a way, how? Well, it's just completely distorted. You have these animals that are talking to each other, and the hunters are always assholes. If it wasn't for hunters, there would be no humans. We'd have never made it this far. If we were all just eating fucking tubers and grapes and shit, we would have never made it. Do you like garbanzo beans? Not bad. I don't prefer it. Have you ever hunted one? No. It's fucking wild, man. How do you do that? You take a bunch of acid. You take a bunch of acid. It's possible. What about the sexual connotations of Disney? Did you ever hear that thing that Walt Disney had the biggest porn collection of all time? Really? That's what I heard. I don't know how much of it is true. Have you ever seen how... There's like the Rod Stewart thing. You know what I mean? I don't know if it's... I don't know how much of it did walt disney have a gigantic porn collection i wouldn't be surprised a lot of people that are like really into kids stuff and like sweet wholesome stuff they did they have that other kind of slant yeah they need or eventually flip maybe maybe it's a cover or maybe it's like they're so cutesy with the fucking completely wholesome stuff that they have to balance it out with some bonded shit some guys getting kicked in the nuts and ball why is it that people feel that people in hollywood and texans are like that like i know people that have moved to texas and they've called me there was one guy that i used to work out with in venice and he started he moved here and and he called me and he'd be like, hey man, you know, the list is coming out. And I'd go, what list? And he goes, you know, the list. The list. And I go, am I on the list? Oh no. And he goes, no, you're clean. You're good. But I know you know who's on the list. You. I'm glad I know I didn't do anything wrong, even though I didn't do anything wrong. And I said, but why are you, like a twofold thing, why are you under the impression that everybody in Hollywood lives under the same roof? Like we all live in the same apartment complex. It's they. It's they. Yeah, they. It's they. They are out there. They're out there doing that thing. Yeah. And then what would, how could you possibly think that a guy who's a trainer at Gold's in Venice would have the list? Why was he chosen? Well, he goes on Reddit. He goes on Reddit. And that's how you get the list. That's how you get the list. That's how you get the list. I still am waiting for the list. Yeah. I think I'm going to see him when I'm here. We started communicating again. Well, we have things like the Epstein client list that doesn't get released. Then it fuels these kind of conspiracy theories about there being a list. So why is that list not released? That's a very good question. Who has that list? Well, for sure someone has the list. Ghislaine Maxwell's in jail, right? So she must have talked. There must have been conversations. And there must be a bunch of very powerful people that are on that list. Are all the powerful people in cahoots? Something that I learned. When I played W, I played a senator. What was that like? What is it like playing a guy who's still alive? Did you meet with him? Scary, I wanted to. Did you ever meet him? No. God, that's weird, right? I had the opportunity to meet him afterwards. And there was something about him that was more, I remember when he was like giving candy to Michelle Obama and all that. Yeah. It was like a really friendly kind of a mischievous thing. And I was like, I would like to meet him. And then I saw his paintings of his dogs and I said I don't want to meet him I just don't like it was something attractive for a moment and then I was like I don't know and I love paintings I don't know what it was but you didn't like the paintings I no it's not that I didn't like the painting there's something in the painting there was I don't know what it was something in the paintings is I killed a million people with fake weapons of mass destruction You know there was we had a fake story and I used that story to justify an invasion of a country and now a million people are dead So that's the question. I'm haunted every night totally paint dogs That are staring like that like your face right now is exactly how every eye is and his dogs paintings It's so funny. That guy must be medicated. They must put him on some things so he could sleep. Is that that look? I think. Does he put into his dog's eyes the look that he has always or at least that he feels that he has? Like there's a haunted. His lens. His real look behind his eyes. Yeah. How he sees the world. How he's experiencing the world. What is it like running around knowing that that you did that not just that you did that but that there's no culpability like no one went to jail for that no one even got brought up on charges well that's what i was bringing up because when i would meet these people i would you know i went to the senate floor and i met a lot of these people and then i met a lot of rich people which is when i met trump actually the 21 Club back when I knew a lot about him I was fascinated by the whole what's the 21 Club 21 Club is a place that he used to go a lot and it was like you know yeah you have a chance to meet this billionaire this bill Trump yeah so he was I gonna say is he Oh meeting these people especially getting them drunk you know where people get super honest right you know where they go you know you know i mean i trust you i trust you and you're like here it comes here it comes whereas before that they were like you know i'm not sure and i just what i think is you know and then they finally go i just fucked her i fucked her. You know, and you're like, oh, or they tell you what's going on. But the thing that I learned and I'm really curious about, like what we were talking about Hollywood and the perception of them all being in it together is don't you think the rivalries and all that, not entirely, but that all politicians are basically under the same roof. They all know what each other's doing and that there's more of an agenda of power to keep the public Thinking a certain way well, this not brainwash certainly a benefit to that of course there Yeah, there's a benefit to that and then there's also the the underlying factor is money Of course like there's so much money and influence. There's so many special interest groups. There's so many lobbyists. That's what I mean. So many massive corporations that are donating to campaigns. Yeah. So there's always going to be this desire to sort of color things in a certain life. Pacify. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. And then treat you like you're a baby so they can continue making insane amounts of money. That's exactly right. If you're someone like Nancy Pelosi, and you're worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and you make $170,000 a year, and there's no fucking explanation, just that alone, you have to kind of keep people in the dark. You have to kind of keep dancing. Otherwise, you're going to jail. Someone's going to start investigating, and they're going to go, what you did is not legal, and you're going to be in real trouble. What's your relationship like with money? In what way? Just in what you made a certain amount of money for a long time. I don't think about it. You don't think about it? No, no. What I like about money is to not think about it. That's what I like. Do you like spending it? I like buying stuff. Me too. I have a nice car. I drove here. I drove a 69 Camaro. See, but that's different. Yeah, I like that. That's fucking different. That's character. I like fun stuff. Fun stuff. But for the most part, I'm not interested in it as a goal. What I like about money is not having to think about it. My friend Brian Callen said this to me once. He said, he goes, real freedom is when you can go to a restaurant and not worry about what anything costs. He's like, everything else is bullshit. It is. And it really is. Everything else is bullshit. When you just go to a restaurant, get a nice steak, you know, order a bottle of wine, have a good time and not think about the bill. What I think happens is, is, and be grateful for it. And to remind yourself to be that, that that's to be grateful for yeah and not be taken advantage of and i think that's one of the hardest things about money slash power is you start treating things as if they're underneath you you know yeah where you go god i'm so glad i can go anywhere in the world right now and get a meal and i don't have to think about how am i going to pay for this yeah am i going I going to be in debt on my credit card? But when you start saying, excuse me, I said 204 degrees, not 190. Right. Read my list. And you're like, oh, man. That's just gross. It is gross, but it happens. That's just taking advantage of this relationship that everyone knows where service people have to be nicer than they really would be normally like a regular person so people that hoping for a tip hoping for one of your many hundreds of thousands or hundreds of millions of dollars disgusting it's a gross way to treat people but some people want to get rich so that they could do that to people maybe someone did it to them when they were younger and they're like i can't wait to do this to other people i mean when you said nice car and you were like i thought you were gonna say i was like oh please no like lamborghini no i don't have any of those and then no i like muscle cars i like old muscle cars that's my favorite that's like me at 37 knucklehead and people say i was at an affectation i know you're friends with momoa or whatever i go no man I've been riding motorcycles since I was three and a half years old. They're fun. They're not only fun. There's something on us. If you read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, which is the only book that's ever been written that kind of gets close to the kind of spiritual place. If you're a true motorcyclist, whether you're riding with your son or whether you're riding with a grid of guys or whatever, that beautiful thunderous hum when you're in a group of guys who really know what they're doing and you're in absolute fucking sync. Yes, your arms are up here and your arms are pretty numb at that point, but you're fucking soaring. You're an eagle on a fucking jet stream. You ever heard of s thompson in you know that documentary they did gonzo yeah like that that in the documentary the very beginning he talks about riding a motorcycle oh i don't remember that coast highway i don't remember that oh it's fucking great see if you can find that he talks about riding a motorcycle how about like that the the lines begin to blur yeah yeah yeah and you just you're just on the edge and how alive you are it's a fucking we don't have to get into this book right away but there was i wrote they came to me it's the only story that i wrote that somebody asked me to write for the book and they were like well you're really into motorcycles why don't you write a story about motorcycles and i tried and it was just bad and bad and everything i wrote was like so forced and bullshit and finally I said I can't do it I'm not going to write it in the minute I said I'm not going to do this I started writing it just kind of started to come out and it's good do you write by hand I do yeah mostly do you feel more of a connection no that's not why I do it because I'll write any which way whether it's on the phone whether you know I remember people, I write, you know, by hand. I handwrite because it's the way it used to be. And I was like, yeah, it also used to be under candlelight, which fucked your eyes out. You know what I mean? Also used to be people had slaves. Yeah. You can only get around by horse. Paint on caves and shit. Why don't you go paint on a cave? Tell me a story. Try to get it published. Yeah, get a witch doctor to take care of your broken leg. I don't care how it comes out. I think real writing is anywhere, anytime, however you can get it out. I don't think there's a muse that's needed. I think it's work, man. It is work. I think the muse is like, it's a concept, right? Have you ever read Pressfield's The War of Art? Yeah, of course. Great book. Great book. I think he's right, though, when he says you summon the muse when you sit down to work. But that's also just like an intention thing. Like you have so much time and effort put on a thing. And when you do that, your mind gets more in sync with creativity. Yeah. But if you treat it like it's a muse, it actually does work. Like if you show up every day and like say. Click into that thing. Pay respect to the muse. I'm sitting here and i'm ready to write and i'm a professional and i'm ready to go and treat it like you're summoning the the muse it actually works it there actually is an effect that happens i don't know if there's an actual muse but you can understand why someone would think that there's a muse because why do people chant why do people meditate why are people that that's the muse whatever the muse is it's like talking about god what's god i don't know it depends on who you're talking to yeah god is a feeling yeah it's something that that fucking thing that keeps you inspired it keeps the gasoline at a high octane well it's something that's how i see it it's something that gets you away from your ego like like with writing. Something that gets you away from your ego and into your mind, into your consciousness, into your perceptions of things, your ability to express it. And it's a focus thing. And the more you focus on it, the more that muscle grows, the more you get adapted to it. Because your ego is worried about how people are going to perceive you. Right. And that's not right. Yeah. You want to look cool. You want to look cool. People are like, You want to look cool people like fuck I read that book then you wrote man. Holy shit. I had no idea you're amazing That's the grossest conversation ever cocktail party in Hollywood. Some guy comes up to you tells you you're amazing. You are a genius I had and it's always with those own crime. I had no idea Meanwhile that guy's trying to sell you on some multi-level marketing scheme or something. There's something he's trying to tap into you with. I want to buy that book. I want to auction your book. Oh, here it comes. I also have a script I'd love you to see. Yeah. Is it a Disney? Is it about animals talking? I really love about living in Texas is there's no Hollywood. There's no show business. I don't have to deal with any of these people with like alternative agendas We just moved to say we just I want to go back to that, but we just moved to Santa Barbara Awesome Santa Barbara. It's funny. I love everybody fucking think that it is a Cito. I love it out there So why ready because it's beautiful because it's beautiful. people? I'm not. They're a little elitist. There's a lot of elitist people out there. So that's a perfect place for me. So I grew up in Santa Barbara. I was in Paso Robles, which is ranch country, about two hours above Santa Barbara. And then we moved to Santa Barbara when I was 11. And it was Montecito, but it was a very different Montecito. Like, yes, couple of rich people yes my dad was doing okay by then he had done Marcus Welby he did at that time he did Amityville Horror so he had a little bit of money but we bought you know what would now be a 35 million dollar home in Montecito he bought for 600 thousand dollars same fucking house do you know what I mean so it was a different Montecito and then whatever you know group i i grew up with but i went to the point is i went to jail there a lot i just did i just liked it instead instead of the museum i went to jail i was like no mom i'm gonna go to jail today um and then so in la venice beach i love venice beach but venice even changed. You know, used to know everybody and everybody kind of coexisted beautifully. And then Venice Beach changed. It got totally randomly violent. Yeah, it became very dangerous. Very dangerous. Little kids. Okay, so we moved to Malibu. We're close to Laird. I know Laird and Gabby and all that thing. But it never landed. So we were always talking about moving, even though we were kind of building a house and we were finalizing everything. We're always talking. We talk about Texas. My mom's from Texas. We were talking about East Coast. We were talking about Europe, all these places, but never Santa Barbara. I would never move back to Santa Barbara. Because by the way, honey, if we move to Santa Barbara, which you love so much and you think is so beautiful, our little girls will eventually for sure go to prison. That was in my mind. Why? Because in my mind, I had built totally. Most of my friends that grew up in Montecito are dead. Really? 36 out of 50. Really? Oh, yeah. From what? Heroin epidemic, punk rock. Oh, God. Driving accidents. 36 out of 50? Out of 50. Wow. Best friend, Jason Sears, who was the lead singer of Rich Kids on LSD, RKL, which was a big punk band that influenced a bunch of people. Nirvana, Pearl Jam, all these people. Rich Kids on LSD is a great name for a band. You should look it up. Can you look it up? Jason Sears, Rich Kids on LSD. We got a tattoo at the same time. I got a tattoo from Freddie Negretti that's gone now because I removed it. But it was a big Jesus with blood coming out of the hands. And Jason that same night got eat shit on his ass. See if you can find Jason's ass that says eat shit on it. Wow. When we finally said, look, we're not moving, we should be grateful, we're not grateful enough. That's the problem. We're not grateful enough. But Malibu just didn't kind of sit. And then one day I'm lying on my bed. What didn't you like about Malibu? I love Malibu. It's just remote. We already are remote in Paso Robles. We have a place in Paso Robles, a place where I grew up, not the ranch I grew up. It's about three miles down the road. But that's remote and a remote that I love. I love remote, but I love extremes. I don't want to be sort of next to Santa Monica and it's 20 miles away and it takes two and a half hours to get there. Right. You and I were talking about that. I don't want to sit in traffic for half my life. Right. I just don't want to. Yeah. If I'm going to be somewhere, I want to be somewhere. So Santa Barbara represented a place where you kind of had your own piece of property, but everything was 10 minutes away. You got dance class for the girls. You got soccer. You got this. You know what I mean? So that was the thing. But never was I going to go back to Santa Barbara. I finally put on Zillow Santa Barbara. One house came up and that's the house that we bought. And it was Joe Walsh's old house. Oh, wow. Which is amazing. That's incredible. Incredible. That's incredible. And I asked him, anyway, I have to finish the story is that I was so freaked out about moving up to Santa Barbara. I still hadn't made the kind of transition that I contracted a mild case to a Bell's palsy. Really? Yeah. Like literally was stressing out. My wife was like, you got to, and I'm not a stress guy. And she was like, you got to mellow the fuck out. I'm like, yeah, but you don't know what's going to happen when we move up here. It's like, it's going to be a face. So literally I'm washing my face. I'm doing this. And it just started going. When was this? Four months ago. Okay. That's a side effect of the vaccine, too. That's one of the side effects of COVID-19 vaccines. I've heard that. And I've also heard that speech impediments have also—I've heard a lot of things. Kids taking vaccines and things happening. Yeah. Yeah. That vaccine in particular. That one. The mRNA one. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I know quite a few people that develop Bell's palsy from them. Well, whatever you want to call it. Are you serious? Yeah, facial paralysis. Yeah. I know two people specifically that develop facial, like droopy face. Because when my older kids were young, there were what, 17 vaccinations? And now that my younger kids are young, there's 56. 72. Yeah. Yeah, It's a series of them, but it's ultimately 72 shots. Yeah. Yeah. And it's a scary prospect, man. Well, the fucked up thing is if you talk about it, you're an anti-vaxxer and you're talking about anything. But that's a big one because they've done a really good job of demonizing anyone who questions a medicine that might be correlated with a bunch of fucking serious diseases. Yeah, exactly. And for whatever reason, they've just done a great job of gaslighting people and scaring the shit out of people by labeling anybody who did, like, look what they did to Jenny McCarthy. Do you remember when Jenny McCarthy had a kid and her kid had autism and she thought that autism had possibly come from vaccines and they basically ran her out of Hollywood. But why would they do that? What's the reason? What do they benefit? Well, the thing is, during the Reagan administration, the vaccine companies, pharmaceutical drug companies that are making vaccines, they said, we are unable to make these vaccines if we're liable. Because if we're liable, there's too many lawsuits are going to come our way because vaccines cannot be completely safe and effective just by virtue of the mechanism in which they work. You know, you have an irritant, you have this virus, this dead virus. Your body sees the aluminum or whatever it is. It reacts to that in a negative way and it finds the dead virus. It develops antibodies just by the way they work. When you vaccinate an enormous amount of people, you're going to have a certain amount of people that have a negative reaction. If we have lawsuits for every person that has a negative reaction, we're going to go out of business. So they made them immune. They made them immune. And you know what happened? Immediately, they're like, well, you need a vaccine for this. And you need to go vaccinate that. Knowing that there was no drawback. Hepatitis B vaccines. Babies. Right when you're born. Right when you're born. Right when you're born. You know, there's also doctors that say it doesn't even really work for babies. But what you're doing is you're conditioning the parents to accept the fact that your child is going to get regularly vaccinated. My doctor, fortunately, our pediatrician wanted to put the kids on a different schedule, a slower schedule. And he didn't want them to have any vaccines until they were two. Your doctor in California? Yes. But it was not like a quack. He was like, I think the way to do it, I mean, yeah, there's a schedule of vaccines your kids have to get unless you have religious exemption. But let's not assault your children with a potential poison because everybody is different. If I take a bong hit, I might end up under the table. If you take a bong hit, you actually may feel smarter and clearer. I remember Dean Potter, who was a climber, and he was like, I stopped smoking pot for four months. But when I started smoking pot, I could feel the hold at 2,000 feet. Oh, yeah. Sheer cliff. Nothing underneath, no ropes. But I felt more confident. And for me, I go, if I took a bong hit up there, I could be four feet up and be freaking out. Right. It's different for everybody. Because everybody has different brains. It's like psychopharmaceuticals. Let's just give them all lithium or let's give them all that. You have to experiment. The idea of experimenting with that shit is super scary. It is. It is super scary. And it's also super scary when you're not liable for any of the repercussions. And you just pushing it on people because you're a corporation and corporations just want to make money. Their thing is just unlimited growth. They have an obligation to their shareholders. Every quarter they want to make more money and they just keep ramping it up. I remember Seinfeld talking about that. He was like, I remember back in the 70s and comedy, you know, green rooms and all that. We'd all be fucking with each other. And it had never had anything to do with money because nobody was really making money. Like money, money. Like tons of money. It was just about what set are you going to do? What are you trying out? Right. Are you going to fail? Are you not going to fail? Right. But it was this community again. And I think that things have grown into not that I wanted to talk about this or they even thought about it before. But the money thing is a very interesting thing to me. You know, and if you want to take it back to the book, which we know about later, money is the anti celebrity. It's like, how do you stay grounded? How do you stay accountable? And why would you stay accountable? Because I actually give a fuck about people instead of just being in it for myself. Yeah. away yeah you get scared it's gonna go away because now you realize oh my god it's so much better to not have to worry about your bills and so much better to have some money to buy things yeah and then you start thinking only about money and you start making decisions only for money and then you go down the weird road and it you know really distorts artists it it fucks a lot of people up yeah you know you see it in a lot of bands they start making like poppy songs when they used to be like raw and gritty when they were younger they used to be it used to be like authentic and then all of a sudden they're Yeah. lover as a kid to see them you know go from like dream on to like the shit they were and I wonder with like drug addiction and all that I wonder if it's like if the parallel is I went back to heroin at that point because I just couldn't fucking deal do you know what I mean I think it's when they get off heroin and they start wanting to make money I need to make some money I spent all my fucking money but look at I wonder if there's any connection like with, remember Philip Seymour Hoffman, like one of the greatest actors that ever lived. And I've known his mother since I was doing theater in Rochester, New York. It was like a 20 year old, 21 year old. And she would come up to me. She said, I think you're a fine actor. And I go, oh, thank you very much. And she goes, you know, my son just moved to New York. He wants to be an actor. And I said, oh, what's his name? Phil. Phil's his name. Oh, well, tell Phil good luck. Good luck to Phil. It's like anybody who wants to be an actor, just the odds of it happening, it's just not going to happen. And then Phil became this guy, 22 years of sobriety, who had an inkling in the beginning and said, you know what? I don't want this to control like my thing. So I'm not going to do it. I'm going to give everything I am to acting and I'm going to try to make the best career, theater career, movie career, whatever. And then, you know, and I, again, I have it in the book where I see him on the street and I'm crazy and I've gotten into a fight with my wife and I'm walking down Columbus Avenue and I have cords on I have no shoes I have no shirt on my women out of my fucking head and I look to my left and I see Nick Nolte at a cafe and we lock eyes and I've never met Nick Nolte I've never seen him and it will happen that I actually will have a relationship with him later on but we lock eyes and the moment is he's seeing in me what he used to be or seeing in me what I'm to become. I'm seeing in him what I'm to become later, right? Right. Then I see Philip Seymour Hoffman who's standing there talking. I go, hey, Phil, it's Josh. What's up? You're doing so well, man. Fuck, Good for you, dude. No shirt. No shirt. No shoes. And he's standing there with one foot pointed toward me and another foot pointed in the direction that he wants to go. You know how people stand there and they're like, could you see him, man? Yeah, good. Good. Oh, no. Now, how is that the guy that died of a heroin overdose? Did he get injured? No. No? He just got back on it? Because sometimes what happens is people get injured. I know. And they have surgery and then they have back and then they get on Oxycontin. I know quite a few people. Me too. I know a lot of people that that's kind of been the trajectory. No back pain, nothing? To me, there's another parallel. And the parallel is I just want to make money. Finally, I'm sick of doing independence. I'm sick of doing this and not making any money. And then you start doing, you know, whatever he was, Hunger Games. And then you feel hollow. And then you want to fill yourself. Right. You want to numb yourself up because you feel like a whore. You feel like a whore. Yeah. It's like there's one one thing about like actually finding solace and saying, hey man, I'm older. I'm going to do this movie. I get it. I would like, you know, I got college coming up for my kids and you justify it in a way that's okay. And then there's one thing about you've identified yourself so much as an artist that to release yourself from that identity in other people's minds, again, going back to the ego, that it just fucks you up. Right. You just can't deal. And then you want to escape from your reality. Exactly. Yeah, you want to numb yourself. Yeah. Well, that is a real fucking thing, man. And if you've ever done a project where it's like really – I did a really bad sitcom once. And I remember – You acted it? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It was terrible. And I remember while while I was doing it I was just imagining like what if this is my life what if this stupid piece of shit sitcom goes for like 10 years and I have to keep you because there's sitcoms that inexplicably are very successful or were the 90s yeah and very successful and they were terrible terrible they're terrible people love them well people want to be cream. They just want to slack jaw, sit in front of the computer or whatever, the TV, and eat SpaghettiOs, just fucking numb themselves to some mundane bullshit. And if you're doing that kind of a thing, you live in hell. And a lot of those people that do those things, they wind up doing drugs because they just feel very lost. But if you do that and you're doing it, you live in hell. Yeah, you live in hell. Which it is. To me. To you. It sounds crazy to a person listening. Oh, you're making $50,000 a week. How are you living? You're living in hell. Like, what are you talking about? No, no, no. That's not the point. Most people would be like, that's great. That would be amazing. But if you want to do a thing, if you want to be a great comic or you want to be a great actor, and you're doing something. You have to have incentive. Right. You have to want to create something really good. Right. And when you can't create something really good, and you're just doing it for money, you feel trapped, and you feel like shit. And then you have to reward yourself for this stupid fucking thing you do. Yeah. So what do you do? You go out and buy a nice Mercedes. You get a fucking house in Malibu. Now you have a large monthly nut that you have to cover. But when you take people over your house, like, look how I'm living. Yeah. Look at this ocean view. Come on. How much of this house do you use? Nothing. Almost nothing. I always say to my friends, my young comic friends that are coming up, your house is just your house. I remember when I first got a nice apartment when I moved to North Hollywood in 1994, I got a loft apartment and a pool table in it and a nice stereo. And I was like, this is incredible. I have a nice apartment. This is amazing. And then after a while, it just became my house. It became where I live. And I realized at that moment, I'm like, oh, it's all the same feeling. Like, all you need in a house is it to be comfortable. You need a TV and a kitchen and a couch and a bed. It's the place that you sleep. Yeah, it's a place where you relax. It's not the place place where you live the entirety of your life you can relax almost anywhere that's comfortable and safe that's all you need and then everything else is kind of bullshit yeah it's kind of the things that you get for your money it's like there's a lot of things that people spend a lot of money on and they're not really worth it you don't really get anything out of it that's why it was interesting walking in here and you know man cave. I hate that fucking term man cave man cave You know it's a gay cave. You know well It's man cave because no woman would ever let me decorate this place this way But it's not that no woman wouldn't like it. I think there's there's some my wife likes it when she comes here She doesn't want to live in it. She doesn't want to live. Do you want to live in it? No, I wouldn't want to live here. Well, there you go. But I might if I was like a single guy. I might decorate my house like this. But it's things. The point is that there's things when I walked in here, it made me smile because I started seeing things that inspire. And you like to surround yourself like if somebody comes in and does an interior design of your office. Ugh. Ugh. Yeah. ugh. And they go, we brought in this amazing fabric from Paris. And you go, but I don't like it. And I remember when we were doing our house, we were like, I said, look, man, you can get things from Target. I don't want to feel that people have to take, I don't want anybody to feel that they have to take their shoes off. That's what I don't, I want them to feel that they can scuff up the floor because that's the mark that they made when they walked in my house. And maybe I don't even like the scuff. I don't like that they walked so heavy. But it's their mark. We are leaving our mark. That's how I feel about this table. That's why this table has all these stains on it. Seriously, it's good. It has character. Yeah, it's alive. And that's the thing. It's like when we built the ranch, I said, there were shelves. I said, I want linoleum. Or what is it? Famaica. Linoleum on the shelves. And we have 150-year-old barn wood, but along with linoleum. Because linoleum reminds me of like trailer parks and shit. It just makes me fucking smile. So I saw this thing when I walked in because I have one. And that ralph stedman's print that you oh okay the hunter is the story so so ralph stedman johnny depp gave me ralph stedman's number because he was close with hunter and my son was graduating my son's an artist and he was obsessed with stedman right and i called ralph stedman he's hello and i, I said, listen, you don't know me. I'm a friend of Johnny's and this. I said, you know, my son's graduating and like the greatest gift I could ever get him. And this is not just to throw Stedman under the bus because it comes full circle. But he says, I said, my son's graduating. Can you do like a little thing? I'll pay you for it. Can you do just draw a little thing for? For his graduation, there was a long, long pause. And he goes, why the fuck would I do that? And so that conversation went nowhere. I was like, what the fuck? What an asshole. And then 20 years went past, and my book is designed by one of his protégés. Oh, wow. And then, so Joey Feldman, he called me one day and he said, he said, Ralph wants to send you a print. And I said, no way. Does he know that we have like a history? And he said, no, I don't think so. So I sent him a voice memo of the history. And I said, I never held it against you. I totally understand I totally understand it especially somebody so he sent me one for my son and one for me That's cool. I love having that thing man. He was an interesting artist. He is very interesting Yeah, I should say is but I mean the the stuff that he did it's like that's also in that Gonzo documentary where it talks about how hunter gave him acid and mushrooms and he just started fucking writing yeah drawing like really crazy shit yeah and like um the thing for do you remember the thing he did for um the the kentucky derby is yeah that was like the first thing wasn't it yeah i think that was how they got together you can find that the kentucky derby is decadent and depraved. Yeah. It's a really good article, actually. Whoa, that was fast, dude. Yeah. But look at that. That article is fucking amazing. It's an amazing article. It's one of my favorite Hunter pieces. And I don't think that they spent a lot of time together, but I think... Hunter and him? No, I don't. There's a lot of it in the documentary where they're hanging out together. Really? Yeah, he picks him up at the airport in his VW Bug. No, I know it exists, but I don't think that they spent the amount of time that you would think given that they collaborated so much. I think Ralph was back in Britain and Hunter was... I know. Look at that. Look at that. See, that's the kind of shit... Do you miss that? Like, as part of driving your car and all that? That's the thing from the... Put your headphones on for a second. Yeah. Take the thing out for an honest run down the coast. I would start in Golden Gate Park, thinking only to run a few long curves to clear my head. Ah, it's so good. A wavering sand in the road. That's great. are those who pushed their control as far as they felt they could handle it and then pulled back or slowed down. But the edge is still out there. It was great. It was fucking amazing. What do you love about his writing and what type, like fear and loathing? Well, I was just reading Hell's Angels recently, actually. That's the book that I go back to most. Well, that's really him when he was starting, right? That was the beginning of the sort of gonzo journalism stuff because he was kind of mixing in fiction with reality. And that's one of the things that pissed off the Hell's Angels is that he took a lot of liberties with the truth to try to like paint a picture. Right. Which was his deal, which was his style later on is like exaggerating and kind of romancing his own life. Well, he was out of his fucking mind. Out of his mind, but he was also one of the most brilliant technical writers that ever was. And that's what, that's what's forgotten. Like even people talk about Kerouac and Kerouac was like, you know, he wrote on the road, Oh, wow. That's why I say it goes back to writers. It's a labor. Yeah. You sit down and you write all the fucking time. My friend Ari on his laptop, he's got a little piece of paper above the keyboard that says the first draft of everything is shit. And it's true. It's Hemingway. Yeah. Hemingway wrote that. Yeah. You know, his first book, Hemingway's first book was lost by his wife. What? Yeah. She lost it? Yeah. She grabbed it for him and was on a train. And then she went to the bathroom and actually left the satchel on the seat. And when she came out of the bathroom, it was gone. Oh, my God. Never to be found again. Oh, my God. Yeah, I know. Can you imagine? Oh my God. All that work. Did that marriage work out? I don't think so. I bet you did it on purpose, that bitch. Maybe. I bet you did it on purpose, that bitch. Yeah, man. I love writing. I love when someone's a really good writer because you just get these moments where you're like, yes, oh, yeah, oh, that's it. Yeah. And Hunter had a lot of those moments where you're like, goddammit, that's good. You have so many people who were great young, and I know that there's a danger and a chaos within the vortex within which they lived, but it couldn't survive. Do you what i mean when hunter got he was just too fucking alcoholic yeah and and dylan thomas became too fucking alcoholic and it's one of those things that you go you were literally writing things that aren't possible you were putting together like wordsmithing things that are... Magic. Magic. Yeah, magic. How he was describing it. It's that thing. Whatever it is you're doing, how do you get to that place which most people can't touch? Well, you can't neglect your physical health. That's the problem is that in this chase for the muse, in this dance you do with the drugs and the alcohol and the wild riding and, you know, I'm sure you've seen Hunter S. Thompson's, there's a thing that a reporter, he hung out with Hunter S. Thompson and detailed what a day in the life of Hunter S. Thompson is. Who was it? There's a band called Beardy Man and Beardy Man took me and Greg Fitzsimmons reading off Hunter S. Thompson's routine, his daily routine before he writes, and made a song out of it. It's fucking incredible. See if you can find that. Because the routine was so insane, and this was really what he would do. He would wake up at 2 in the afternoon. No. Chaos. Full on chaos. Here, let's put the headphones back on. Start from the beginning. Beardy man. 3 p.m. Rise. Chivas Regal with morning papers. 345. Cocaine. Another glass of Chivas. Another Dunhill. 405. P.M. By the way, first cup of coffee. That you'll get. 6 o'clock smoking grass to take the edge off the day I don't know what that is cocaine and grass cocaine So this is like a electronic dance music song that plays in clubs sometimes Super funny. When'd you do that?? Oh, it was a long time ago. Many years ago. Did you ever live like that? No, no. I've never even done coke. Wow. Yeah, I've never fucked around with coke. I like psychedelics. I like weed. I like a little alcohol every now and then, but I don't fuck around with anything that's going to kill me. I'm not interested. Yeah. And I'm not interested in anything that helps my ego, that boosts it up, makes me fearless. That bloats it? I'm not interested in any of that. I like things that make me scared. I like things that make me nervous. That's what I was talking about early on. I like to feel vulnerable. I like it. You like to challenge yourself. Yeah. And your perception and how you perceive certain things. I think I like voluntary adversity, physical voluntary adversity, but also I think mental voluntary adversity. And I think that's what I like about like psychedelics. I think there's like you have to go on like a journey and you can't control it. It's you. It takes you somewhere. And then when you're back, you realize like you ain't shit. Just get all that ego stuff out of your system, relax, and just be appreciative and enjoy life and try to spread as much positivity as you can. That's what you're here for. Do your best at everything you do. That's what you're here for. And how do you find yourself doing that once you're not on it? The incorporation of it into your life. Just remember, you know i've it's so there's profound moments where i think you know change you forever and those if you can hold on to them some people don't hold on them but it's a matter of intention right it's a matter of like what are you trying to do you're trying to be better at life well if you're trying to be better at life you can hold on to it if you're not if you're just trying to like be the man or you know exactly you know and get all the accolades or you know win a fucking grammy or whatever you're trying to do like if that's your real goal like you're gonna get lost because it's a shitty goal how old were you when you took a hallucinogen for the first time 30 i was 13 whoa so that's a little too early i wouldn't recommend that i wouldn't recommend it either but it it changed my life. And I had, by the way, I took it twice in a 24-hour period. So I took it 13, had the greatest trip ever, like still affected by it. And then I took it again that night and went to hell. Oh, no. I don't know. You got cocky. No. Psychedelics want to bring you down a notch. It just did what it did. It did. It did. And I truly believe that psychedelics, I don't do psychedelics anymore, but I think I did. But I do breath work. I do shit like that. And you go, can you get there? And I go, yeah, I've had some of the most amazing hallucinations I've ever had. Most profound hallucinations I've ever had. Holotropic breathing, breath work with Laird going off, and if you do it long enough, you just reach a place. Or if you're in a sauna at 240 degrees for an hour doing breath work, you're going to go places. Yeah, no doubt. Sensory deprivation tank, you don't need anything. You trip balls. If they could give you in a pill form the experience you get from a sensory deprivation tank, it would be a very popular drug. Yeah. And it's completely safe. And a productive drug. Yes, very productive. So there's sensory, you say the sensory deprivation tank, but I just saw, you can see it online or whatever, where people literally put a thing, they go into a room and there's silence. It's not like a, you know, where they don't talk, a meditation retreat or whatever. But they literally go into a room by themselves. They don't see anybody else. They put a thick mask on and they're in for four days, five days. Have you seen that? I have heard of people doing stuff like that. Yeah. Sometimes you don't, like, how do I feel about everything? Like, do I even know? Have I ever really considered things? Like, you need time alone. You need time to think. You know, that's what I really like about, that's why I work out by myself. That's why I like to. You work out by yourself? Yeah. You don't like having a trainer? I mean, I've had a lot of trainers. I appreciate them for technical advice and stuff like that. But this is a meditative aspect of working out by myself that I think is very important. It's also discipline. It's easy to go somewhere and the guy tells you, okay, 10 reps. But I write my own workouts out. Based on that day. Yeah, well, I know what I want to do. I'm pretty good at it. It's funny. I haven't heard many people say that. And it's not just some bullshit like affectation, rebellious thing. When I'm with it, assholes. I'm one of those assholes. But I will actually push myself. If, say, 12, just for a random word, a random number, 12 is my limit, I'm good at pushing myself to 15. Or Jeff Cavallari, do you know who that is? No. AthleanX. Oh, yeah, I've heard of that guy, yeah. Super smart guy. Yeah. And we would go back and forth, and I'd be like, look, if I'm at my last three reps, why do we have to rest for two minutes? Like who said that who made that up? Is it really a recovery thing two minutes before you can go back into 12 more reps? What if we just rest 30 seconds and then you're right back into? That thing almost immediately a but and those are the things that are tearing the tissues and growing the muscle and all that kind of stuff. So just experimenting with it all. Again, this all goes back down to what we watched of like what are we doing to just live a little more vividly? How are we pushing ourselves? How are we changing our perception? How are we pushing our perception? Well, it depends on what you're trying to do, right? If you're just trying to get like conditioned, yeah, give yourself the minimal amount of rest and do it for as long as possible and then take time off afterwards for your body to heal and then get back after it. As a base. As just a base. But it depends on what you're trying to do. If you're trying to get strong, I always recommend taking out like long periods of time in between sets. I take like five minutes, maybe even more in between sets. To come back in at your strongest. Yeah, but I have long workouts. My workout's like two hours sometimes, two and a half hours, because I have these long breaks in between. But because of that, it's, you know who Pavel Tatsuliny is? No. He's one of the godfathers of kettlebells. He's one of the first people that introduced kettlebells to America from Russia. And their philosophy, his strong first philosophy is that strength is a skill. And you don't work on a skill when you're tired. So it's all about how many repetitions you do, and that's what builds strength. So it doesn't mean you have to do 10 in a row. Like say if 10 is your max, say if you pick up a weight and you can do 10 cleans and presses, and on the 10th one you're like, his philosophy do five do five wait a long time do another five so you've got the 10 in but you've got the 10 in with perfect form right and then you're still getting the same amount of repetitions but you're not breaking yourself down to the point where you might get hurt or where you're doing it incorrectly or form so that's how i talked i talked to me too i talked to my wife a lot about that. My wife would say because I'm all about form. Yes. Because otherwise you just get hurt and what's the fucking point? Yeah. I rarely get hurt from lifting weights. Have you ever gotten hurt in jujitsu? Oh yeah. A lot. Everybody tears and pops and meniscus. I've had surgeries and fucking bulging discs and torn this and torn that. Yeah, you have to. It's a sport where you're trying to kill each other. It's true. You try to get really good at killing people with your body. So other people are doing that to you. I had sciatica for a year and a half. Bad sciatica. Nine millimeter slip between L5 and S1. How'd you get rid of it? And they wanted to do surgery. And I had had surgery when I was really young because I had a slipped disc between C5 and C6. And they took out part of my hip and they went in through my neck. They moved everything over and they replaced my disc with part of my hip. Back when they used to do that. They replaced your disc with part of your hip? Yeah, they would chisel out a part of your hip. Like a bone? Yeah. And that's what your disc was now? A piece of bone? It is now. That doesn't even make sense. Your disc is supposed to be spongy. I know. I don't understand why. They put a piece of bone in there? Yeah, and it worked. Really? It actually worked, yeah. Dr. Delamorter. I'll never forget his name. Jesus. So yeah. And then they used cadaver bone for a while and now they use what? Well, it depends. There's artificial discs. I know a couple of people that have artificial discs. And it worked. Yeah. My friend Eddie got it done in his lower back. He was basically bone on bone, constant inflammation. So he got a a titanium articulating disc that's in his back. What is this? Surgeon may take a small piece of bone from the hip called an autograft to use in a neck surgery called interior cervical disectomy and fusion. The bone is placed between the space between the vertebrae to stimulate bone healing and promote fusion. Oh, so you got your neck fused. Yeah, they call it a Brolin graft. Oh, really? No. Hey. Hey. Wow. So that's different. You got your hip, your neck fused. Fused. Yeah. Which they probably don't even do fusion. They do. They still do fusion. Well, if it's a massive break or something like that, maybe. Yeah, I don't recommend it. There's other ways you can heal bulging discs. And one of them is there's a process called Regenikine. And Regenikine is, I had that done in LA, in Santa Monica. They used to do it in Germany. You used to have to go to Germany to do it. And like Kobe Bryant went over there and Peyton Manning went over there. And what they do is they take your blood out. It's like platelet-rich plasma, but it's a more advanced version of it. And they spin your blood in the centrifuge and they add some stuff to it and it turns it into one of the most potent anti-inflammatories. And then what they do is you lie down there and they inject it in your back. They have these little needles. I think there's an Instagram post of me getting it done on my lower back. Did you have a slipped disc in your lower back? Bulging. Bulging. It's essentially a bulging disc, but it can go back. Bulging disc can go back. That was my experience. You also have to have traction like decompression. Yeah. So there's a bunch. There it is. So that's my back. I had that done. So they take that and they stick all that shit. But all that. And they drill that, don't they? They just put holes. That's a drill. No, it's just needles. No, but I know it's needles, but it's not like acupuncture. They actually drill that. Then they put the needle in, don't they? No. No, they just shove that needle in place. It's just like a syringe. On each side of your spinal column, right? Yeah. It's like a syringe. And then inside the syringe, they pump in the Regenicaine stuff. Yeah. And then it fills those areas up with this platelet-rich plasma that's been enhanced, and it just heals everything. And did you feel like it helped? Oh, yeah, absolutely. It helped my neck so much. My neck was so fucked. My neck was so fucked. I was getting numb fingers and pain in my elbow. I have that now. Do you really? You should go go to that place. And when I ride motorcycles also, I have my hands up like that. I mean, I have shoulder issues. But I have a – that slip disc was a 9-millimeter slip. Why do you like to do this? Huh? Why not do this? Why this? Because that looks cooler. Does it? Not to me. It looks super cool when you're doing it right now. This looks retarded. This looks retarded. This looks good. This looks like you can avoid things. Put it up super high. You can move around. Put it up super high. This is like –. When you have to turn, how are you going to turn like that? You're not going to do a good job. You look like a gorilla. This is better. This is better. What about that? This is better. What about this? Well, Ducatis. I mean, that's like you're down like this, right? That's when I finally crashed was a Ducati. Oh, really? You went crazy? No, I didn't go crazy. I didn't do anything differently. With parlies, you go slower. Right. You ride. And it's loud, so people know you're there. Thank you. That's a big one. It's huge. They have electric bikes now. I'm like, do you want to die? They're fast. They're so fast. But do you want to die? They make no sound. Nobody can hear you. Nobody can hear you. If I'm riding in a grid of 16 guys, because everybody thinks Hells Angels. I go, there's nothing about it that's trying to emulate Hells Angels, Mongols, any of that 1%-er thing, but when you hear that rumble coming down the road, you can't wait to get the fuck out of the way. Yeah, oh yeah, yeah. And that helps us. That's true. That definitely helps you stay alive. Yeah, loud pipes save lives. I've heard that many times. So to finish that thought, what I did was is I went to, I started, instead of resting, which is what doctors normally say, they say do surgery, do surgery, rest, sleep, see if that helps. If it doesn't help, do surgery. And I did the opposite, which later, you know, Laird was like, anytime you get hurt, Laird will be like movement, movement, movement, movement movement movement but this was before all that but I started working out and it got worse and it got worse and it got worse but I continued to work out and I started running and I started doing pistol squats and all this kind of shit and then one day it was gone and I never came back really never came back so you just beat it out of you I beat it out of me. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. Movement is everything. You need circulation. You need blood in there, which is why they do PRP, which is why they do stem cell work or whatever. Yeah. And if you're just sitting there, the problem is you're also going to, your body's going to atrophy. You're going to lose strength and then it's going to make whatever injured that area in the first place. That was always promoted by doctors. Why would that always be promoted by doctors? Again, whether it's politicians or whether it's doctors or whether it's – they're telling you this is – you got to eat from the four food groups, man. You're going to die otherwise. Well, there's a lot to that stuff. But the four food group shit is a lot of it. It's people just not knowing what the fuck they're talking about. That's what I mean and also Different perception back then of like what was healthy versus now, but it's also a lot of these doctors They're not athletes and they don't really understand like what's possible with the body They just know how to fix things when they break and then for the average person They say just rest because the average person is not gonna fucking do what you. So it's like, why, why tell them like what you really need to do is movement, constant movement and just beat that injury into submission. That's right. And no one's going to tell you that. How do I feel better? Lose some weight. Yeah. Like go, go do that uncomfortable thing. Start walking, start slow, maybe jog a little bit, maybe lift a little something. That's why when you see those videos of these guys that just, for whatever is in their personality, they've had fucking enough. They're 400 pounds and they go, that's it. Buck stops here. I'm going to start doing my shit. Yeah, they hit rock bottom. They hit rock bottom. And then you see this, again, what we were talking about before, incentive, where they just go, I don't give a shit. Well, isn't that the same with everything? Isn't that how you quit drinking? You just hit rock bottom? I was just about to say that. Yeah, but you don't. I hit rock bottom when I was 15. I was shooting coke at 15. Jeez. So, yeah, the thing that you didn't want to try, I did want to try. But that was that group. That's why so many of those guys died. Yeah. You know what I mean? So when I look at Hunter S. Thompson, who I love as a writer, when I look at Dylan Thomas, who I love as a writer, and all these guys that had this kind of amazing life, and I feel, too, parallel. I had an amazing life, except nobody cared about mine. People really cared about theirs. I was just Josh that you wanted to stay the fuck away from. We're like, that motherfucker's great to spend like an hour with, and then once it hits 10 o'clock Yeah, and comes out and the clouds part. You don't want to be right around Yeah, yeah, then you get to that point where you go. When did hunter s Thompson? When did these guys just become like? Some kind of clown mask of themselves, right? Do you know what I mean? Well in the end hunter was definitely that you ever see when hunter was on Conan O'Brien show No, it was horrible. He could barely talk. He barely could understand him. His everything was mumbling Was every it was real weird and you know, he was he got a gunfight with his fucking neighbors He's like shooting at his neighbors. That's what I mean. It's at what point does it turn on drunk? But wasn't just that. His body was like rapidly deteriorating. He had hip replacement surgery. And he was only 67, I think. That's not old, man. No, not that old. That's young. Not that old for what? How old are you? 57. I'm 56. Yeah. Like my mom died at 55. The whole thing this book became was my mom dying at 55 and me thinking back then, she lived a nice life isn't that crazy it's fucking crazy and then it turned out that i was 55 when i wrote the book which i'd never even the book kind of dictated itself and then i went holy fuck i'm 55 wow i'm super young fucking super young like this i have some joint issues but i'm young right for the most part. For the most part. Yeah, you're physically healthy. You're not falling apart. You just have a few issues, which is just wear and tear of life. That's it. Yeah, but there's some people that if you don't take care of yourself and you don't eat well and there's also a lot of other factors, genetic factors, but you could fall apart pretty quick. But if you're a guy like Hunter that's doing coke and drinking every night, you can't do that. No, you can't. It just won't. And the writing was bad. Yeah. It was I forget who he wrote it for but he wrote this really great piece talking about what happens next after the Twin Towers fall It's like he wrote this thing about waking up in the morning seeing the Twin Towers fall and then realizing What's what's ahead for us? Right? It was very pressing. It was very good. It was very it was accurate Dead-on it was dead-on and it was vintage Hunter. It's like he tapped back into it again. It's on ESPN. ESPN, that's it. ESPN, this is the article? Yeah, this is the article. Would you send me this article if it's an article article? Yeah, I'll send it to you. I would love that. This is the whole thing. Right. That's one of the more interesting pieces because you got this guy who's following around the campaign trail and he knows he's only in it for this one time. So he's not like any of these other reporters. He's just writing a book. Yeah. What are you going to do? Fire him? Yeah, exactly. And not only that, you can't because he's going to write a book. Like he's writing a book. You can't fire him. Whether you like it or not. Yeah, whether you like it or not, he's writing that book. But, you know, he's dropping acid. He's talking to these guys into drinking. Like he's taking all all these fucking nerdy political reporters and he's introducing them to a perspective that they're not aware of. They don't know anybody like that. And the book is fucking incredible. But when you see Gonzo, when you see... It's funny how much we're talking about Hunter S. Thompson. But when you see Gonzo, I don't know if it was in Gonzo or another documentary, you see how they're affected by it. You see a humanity in them because of him that you don't normally get to see. Right. Don't you agree? Yes. Yeah. He made you question a lot of things. Yeah. And when people question things, they're like, what am I doing? Yeah. Why am I here? What is my purpose? Or did I have a purpose when I was young and I just fell into this political status quo? And he even was questioning, like in the documentary, he was like, I don't even know what people want anymore. Do they want Hunter S. Thompson or do they want Gonzo? It's not even me anymore. It's like I'm a prisoner of this thing that I've created. And that's the thing that happens to people where they develop this sort of image and persona. And then you feel like you're trapped by it. People have expectations when they meet you. That's exactly right. Kennison talked about that. Did you know Kennison? No. I did. Unfortunately. Did you? I did. No shit. Yeah. And not because of drugs. Just because I was around. What year was this? When did he die? 90-ish to 92 maybe. I was in New York. So it had to be pre 94 Probably 90 somewhere around then I would say 90 I knew him 90 Wow, it was through a friend that I met him and then he liked me Wow and sweet incredibly sweet guy He was a motherfucker dude mother. We just got a this guy does bottle cap art Go to my Instagram Jamie and see that photo this guy just made this insane Bottle cap art piece of kinnison for my comedy club, and we put it up last night. Is he a hero of yours? Oh, yeah, he was one of the first That's all bottle caps like oh no shit. Yeah, those are bottle caps if you wow man. Yeah. That's like in prison when they use cigarette packs and do... Patricia Arquette gave me a piece of art with a bunch of cigarette packs put together. Oh, really? Yeah, they make frames. That was it. Oh, wow. Same kind of thing. Yeah, this guy, his name is Jam Bottle Cap Art, J-A-M Bottle Cap Art. He does a bunch of different pieces with bottle cap art. Yeah, he's really good. It's really, really cool stuff. You need my picture outside. I saw all your mug shots. I'd love to have a mug shot of you. I'll send you one. Is it good? How fucked up do you look? Pretty fucked up. I got a smile on my face. When somebody smiles during a mug shot, I always find that really funny. So when you met Kennison, was it at a show? No. Oh, it might have been the Comedy Club. I'd only been a few times. Sorry, Comedy Store. He was out of there by then. He was out of there by 90. Well, what's the one down the road by where Greenblatt's used to be? Laugh Factory. Yeah. Yeah, you like those? I do. I love those things. Very much. The Laugh Factory. The Laugh Factory. It might have been that. Yeah, he got kicked out of the comedy store, I think, in like 87 or 88. No, it wouldn't have been. Then it wasn't there. Yeah, it was probably The Laugh Factory. But that's not where I met him. I met him at a house. Okay. I met him at a house, and I never went to a lot of those parties. I was just not part of that. Sam wasn't invited. But I met him, just he was really sweet man he would like mellow out it wasn't like a thing it wasn't an act all the time right you know but he was a prisoner to that thing that he became for sure yeah his brother wrote a great book it's called Brother Sam it's really really good book describing like the ascent of his career and how it fucked him up and what happened to him. And what do you think it was? Drugs. Drugs and partying. And stratospheric feeling. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wasn't it instantaneous for him? Pretty quick. So in 1986, he's on Roddy Dangerfield's Young Comedian special. And then he does an insane, to this day, holds up HBO Hour. And then those two things and then an album that he made called Louder Than Hell. And those things are the best things he ever does. Everything after that becomes like a significant drop off. And in the end, he was basically a caricature of who he used to be. Yeah, a caricature of himself, exactly. And he just was captured. Yeah. But it's also— Imprisoned. There wasn't anybody to tell you how to do it back then. There was only a few, like, massively famous comedians back then. There wasn't a lot of us. It wasn't like today. Today, there's like a giant community of comedians. We all talk to each other and figure it out together. And everybody's just about making better stuff. It's not about getting hugely famous. The ones that just want to get hugely famous, they're all mentally ill. And usually their career drops off, their comedy starts to suck. They're trying to do the wrong thing. So in Kinison, in the beginning, he just wanted to be the best he could be he just wanted to be really fucking good at comedy and coming from this you know tent preacher so he's like this revival tent preacher and then he gets in a stand-up comedy and he has this charisma and this ability to deliver that's so different than everybody else and he's this short fat guy so when he talks about being married and living in hell, like kind of like empathize with it. Like this fucking guy's amazing. And revolutionized comedy. Changed comedy. He was the first guy that I ever saw that made me think I could do comedy. Because before then, I loved comedy. I always loved stand-up. But I loved it because it was funny. I would just like to watch, you know, Jerry Seinfeld on TV. Oh, these guys are so funny. Isn't that funny? Because you're're so different than he is and yet He was the one that you paralleled with that like liberated you. Yeah. fighting. And so I was feral. My mindset was just, I just didn't fit in. I couldn't wear a suit jacket and pretend to be the guy. Did you ever notice? I wasn't that guy. Hello, sir. It's great to meet you. Things that I thought were funny, other people would think were fucked up. But my fucked up friends would think were funny. And those are the ones who talked me into doing stand-up. But they were equally fucked up. Did you start stand-up back then? In Boston, in 88. In 88? Yeah. Right on. Yeah, and I went to see Kennison in 89. I got to see him live in 89. I got to see him three times. One time when I was working. Wow. I was working at Great Woods Center for the Performing Arts, and he was performing there. Wow. And I got to see him live. I was a security guard. It was this place in Mansfield. Yeah, the whole Taekwondo team that I was a part of got jobs. Is that what you did, Taekwondo? Yeah. That's what I used to compete in. Oh, no kidding. Yeah. Where'd you compete out of? Junchong. Where was that? L.A. Okay. Taekwondo. Yeah. Yeah, I fought in L.A. when I lived in Boston. I fought in Anaheim in the Nationals. Right on. Right. At the end of his career, like Rodney would go, and by the way, murdered. I mean, I was fucking crying laughing. He was probably, I don't know how old he was in 89, but he was old. And this fucking guy was just on stage with a bathrobe on naked. Killing it. Giant hog, like hanging out of his fucking pants. And he was just hanging out smoking pot. And then he would go on stage with a bathrobe on and just kill. Yeah. Because he helped other comedians. Like Rodney Dangerfield, he did these things, the Rodney Dangerfield specials, like Rodney and Friends. And so he would have, he introduced the world to Dice Clay, Sam Kinison, Robert Schimmel, Lenny Clark, Dom Irera, like some of the greats. And they all came out of his Rodney Dangerfield and Friends specials. They were some of the greatest specials ever because he would have all these guys that he thought were worth seeing. And he would put them out there to the world. And they all became superstars. I mean, that's how Sam Kinison launched. He launched from Rodney. And so Bill Hicks, a lot of people launched from Rodney. And so everybody loved Rodney. He was just loved. I know he's your buddy. And I, you know, because comedians, I used to listen, I used to have six albums and one was a bloody red vinyl. Remember the red albums? Sure. Yeah. Yeah. And it was sick. And I don't know where I got them. I think I got them from like a flea market or something, but they were Lenny Bruce. Oh yeah. And that was the beginning. He was the first, he was the first, he was the first real modern stand-up comedian. Everybody else just told jokes. Like, two guys walking to a bar. Like, that kind of shit. Totally. He was the first guy that was like, why do we do this? And why is that? And like, what is this? Where he questioned it. Yeah. Questioned authority. And people would come to see him because in the 60s, everybody was so confused as to how to think. Like, what? Yeah. What are we doing? And this guy was like this. And how do we treat each other? Yes. And he'd literally point people out. And he'd go, he's been kike. And he's a mick. And people would go, what the fuck is he doing? Right, right, right, right, right. At the most tense time. And then he'd bring it around. And that's why it reminds me of Chappelle. Because Chappelle would get so seemingly or ostensibly inappropriate. And then somehow it around and you go, fucking Jesus. Dave's a master. Master. And he's a real artist. That's a guy, like, you know, I talk about like people that only start thinking about money. Yeah. That's not him. That dude lives in fucking Springfield, Ohio and just travels around and just does a lot of shows for no money. He does a lot of shows for no money. He just shows up and performs. One time I was in Denver and I get off stage. It's the second show Friday night. So it's 10 o'clock show. Show's over. I get off stage. I go into the green room. Dave's there. I go, Dave, what are you doing here, man? He goes, I thought I'd come out and visit you. Just hops on a fucking private jet and flies to Denver because he knew I was there. Didn't even tell me. Just shows then I go do you want to go on stage? He goes Oh shit, I go fuck. Yeah, so I ran out while the people were leaving where they show was already over I go Tell everybody on the stairs come back Dave Chappelle's here So they all come back in and sit down again and how long does like 45 minutes and it was right around when Trump was doing, when he got caught saying, grab him by the pussy. So he had like 10 minutes of a grab him by the pussy. It was fucking genius. It was so good. Off the top of his head though? Oh no. He, I mean, I don't know exactly how Dave creates material. I think what Dave does is spends a lot of time thinking and listening to music and coming up with ideas And he writes some stuff down, but a lot of what he does is just performs Constantly he's constantly on stage working. He said it earlier artist. He's a real artist the difference between Somebody who's just good at what yeah, and somebody who is an innate artist. He's a real artist He's a hero. He gets he's a hero of mine, too He's a good friend, but he gets these giant deals with Netflix where he makes a lot of money, which is great But he doesn't do it for money. Yeah, he's doing it No, but what you can tell is he gets these like oh he turned down 50 million dollars and crazy moved to Ohio or whatever the fucking story is that you want to make up but then he comes back He makes these 20 million deal dollar deals with Netflix, but it's never in place of His agenda. No, it's all about the art. It's all about this wins this wins This is the prior why he left his show because they were twisting it of course story I know it why he left his show because I've been in that position where you go, this is turning into some corporate version of what you like. You love what I do. Now you can't wait to put your fingerprint on it. Exactly. That's it. That's exactly what it was. So you can take, so you can go, you know, that was me. And he gave up 50 million when no one was giving him 50 million. Nobody would fucking do that, man. And then he quit doing comedy for 10 years. And you know what he would would do He would occasionally show up in a park with like a fucking speaker and just show up and do stand-up. Yes, he did He did in Seattle. I know he did in Seattle cuz a friend of mine was at the show He shows up he goes Dave Chappelle just shows up in this fucking park He get a speaker with a microphone and he's just starts talking and people just gather around. He was just doing these shows, these impromptu shows. He would show up in a bar. Can I go on stage? And they would go, okay. And he would just start talking. Knowing in his mind that he would eventually come back? No. That was just the present moment. I think he's just being an artist. Just being an artist for the pure sake of being an artist. So he had the money that he did make off Chappelle show and he decided to like live frugally And take that money and he didn't do anything for money for like ten fucking years He just raised his and then he started coming back and then we started coming back I remember him coming around the Comedy Store again, and we had some conversations about it and he just You know, he just decided to start doing comedy again And then you see people getting cancelled, and it's devastating to them, and yet that's what that was. He just did it himself. Right. He canceled himself. He canceled the greatest sketch show of all time. Of all time. Yeah. And it only did two seasons. It's still the greatest. But that's not something that you see very often. It's somebody who just fucking can't help but beat to their own drum. Right. But the art wins in the end. The art wins. Do you know what I mean? Well, it's obviously when you see him. He's so good. He's not malicious. No. There are moments where you think he's malicious. And again, he brings it around. Well, the maliciousness is just to heighten the humor. It all just brings it in. And it also accentuates some thoughts that you might have about whatever he's talking about But it's what everybody's thinking. Yep. It's so fucking terrified to say that's why I'm thinking me Yeah, I'm watching it and I'm the inappropriate guy, you know, and my dad goes how the fuck do you say what you say? And I don't understand I go, you know, I said honestly, do you want to know because I'm not ultimately mean I don't want I don't want a fucking car I don't want people to feel less than I do right, but I watch Chappelle even me I'm like Wow Yeah, he watched that line he gets out there and walks that line, but he dances around it and he makes it beautiful comedy It's so much without him We're all fucked and he's the way to find out if a comedian's a cunt. Like, if a comedian doesn't like Chappelle, they start shitting on Chappelle, like, oh, okay. Then you know he's a cunt. You're a piece of shit. You're a piece of shit. You're just a garbage human. Have you ever met anybody like that? Yeah, yeah, yeah. A lot of these. He's not a real comedian. There's a lot of. He's an asshole. Yeah, there's a lot of like. That's not comedy. Activist comedians. And what they are is is really not talented So they've glommed on to this idea of like being like socially conscious and that's more important than the humor itself But nobody wants to hear you preach nobody. Nobody thinks that your opinion is better than theirs This is what I always say like if you go on stage you have an opinion like other people have an opinion, too Like if you go on stage and say, you know I think Kamala Harris would be be the greatest president of all time. A lot of people are like, well, I don't agree, but you have to have a way to make it funny so that they laugh. The people that disagree with you laugh. I don't even think this guy's correct, but God damn, that's funny. And that's the way you can introduce an idea into someone's head that maybe would never accept that idea. It was just opinions. So if someone's on stage and they're just saying opinions, you could disagree with that opinion. It'll frustrate you and you can't talk. But if that guy can take that opinion and that perspective and make it funny, then you're forced to acknowledge that he has a point. There's something in there like, I don't even agree with that, but fucker, god damn, that was good. God damn, that was good and that's the liberates yes that's the real Chappelle art that's what I mean not that we'll stay on this forever but remember Eddie Murphy when he did what not the first not raw but delirious delirious yeah oh yeah well he was a fucking powerhouse power to this day that is the guy that I just wish I was friends with. I was friends with his brother, Charlie. Yeah. But I wish that guy, I wish he would come back. You know, I know he got like some weird stuff where he got arrested with transsexuals in his car. So whatever. So did other people. Whatever. They came back. He's just too good. He's too good. He's too good. Do you ever see when he gave a speech? He got like, I think it was like one of those Mark Twain awards or something like that. And he did stand up. Like, where he hasn't done stand up in forever, but he was talking about Bill Cosby having to give his awards back. No. Yeah. Because, you know, he does an amazing Bill Cosby impression. Yeah, I know. I remember. And so he did stand up. And it was as sharp as ever. And like, God damn, if this guy would be— And it was just off the cuff? It was something that— Oh, I'm sure he prepared. No, I'm sure he prepared, but nobody really knew he was going to do it, right? Well, they knew he was going to give a speech, and his speech was essentially stand-up. Was stand-up. You know, his acceptance speech was— Like 20 minutes or 15 minutes of stand-up. Yeah, and it was fucking great. And there was all these rumors that he was going to start doing it again. I remember Charlie told me that Dave was thinking about doing it again or that Eddie was thinking about doing it again. But he never did it. He never did it. I think it's just too heavy. We need comedians. I mean, that's like the theme of this whole thing. Whether you're talking about Hunter, whether you're talking about this, it's just too bad that they self-destruct, whether it be from drugs or fame or whatever. You know what I mean? It's hard, man. It hard to maintain and then once you make it there's these weird pressures but it breaks up the status quo of this contraction especially that we're i know that's why people move to austin yeah i'm fucking sick of being told to think a certain way well that's why comedy in austin works so well yeah because we all moved here at the same time We all moved here in 2020 like I was I was here because well Ron white moved here first and Ron white is a dear friend of mine and he moved here before the pandemic and Ron was like I don't want to live in LA anymore. I fucking love it here. There's no traffic fucking foods Great fucking people are nice. I can I fly. I'm in the center of the country. I can fly anywhere real quick. And I was like, damn, could I live in Texas? I'm like, I don't know about that. And then COVID came. And my wife was kind of interested a little bit. But then when the riots started happening in L.A., then she got really scared. There was a lot of home invasions. It was a lot of crazy shit that was happening. Where is she from originally? She was from Colorado. Okay, yeah, so not an LA born. No, no, no. And so she lived in LA with me for a while, and we were happy. You know, we lived in Bell Canyon, which was, like, outside of LA. It's nice, peaceful, had a little land, coyotes and hawks and shit. Yeah, well, for me it was okay because I had quiet where I lived and then I could drive into the comedy store. And I loved it. But then when they shut the comedy store down, they shut everything down. And I was like, baby, they're not going to let us go back. This is like these fucking cocksuckers have control now. And that's what they like. That's why they became politicians in the first place. They like telling people they can't work. They have a grip on society and they're going to fucking keep this grip. We got to get the fuck out of here. So did you move sight unseen? Did you move just, did you just come? Did you find a place? I came looking for I came and you hung out for a while? I came looking to see if I could deal with it. We took like a few days off and we flew to Austin with some friends who were also thinking about doing it. None of them wound up moving here. A couple of them moved to Dallas. But we came here and then one of the things that helped, my daughters were 10 and 12 at the time. They were real young and they were real confused about what was going on in LA. It was spooky. You know, you had to wear a mask everywhere and that freaks kids out. Like it's just, it's freaky. We came to Texas, no masks. You to restaurants. And we had this great real estate lady and this great – she's a good friend now. And she took us to – we wanted to see this house. And she took us on a ride on a boat. She had a friend to take us on the lake. We go on the lake. People are playing Leonard Skinner. They're jumping in the water. They're laughing and singing. And in L.A., everybody's thinking, like, the world's going to end. There's demons in the air. No, man, I was in New Mexico, and I was out on a 100,000-acre ranch. Whoa. Right? And we were doing Outer Range. We were doing the first season of our show, and we were tested every morning. And when I was out in the middle of nowhere, I mean, with, like, good 15-mile-an-hour winds, you'd have somebody come up. If I put my mask mile an hour winds you'd have somebody come up if i put my mask down to talk you'd have somebody go yeah yeah and i'd be like there's no we're in the middle of nowhere also it doesn't even work it doesn't work it's stupid the mask i'm not even saying that i have a certain belief system or anything but in that moment yeah provable that they don't work if that's a blood type. I don't know. What is that? Maybe you're healthy. Maybe I have it right now. I have a bit of a cold right now. Maybe you have it. The new COVID is a joke. It's like, well, we used to test every day. We used to, like, everybody that came in, because I wanted to be compliant. I wanted people to feel safe. People were flying out here to do podcasts. I wanted to make sure that they're not a dick. And so we tested everybody before every show. And one time I came in, Yeah. and famously got in trouble for saying that I didn't get vaccinated, but I got healthy. And it was the CNN attacks and all that shit. And then the second time I got COVID, it was literally sniffles. And it was gone in like a day or two. So were the numbers different in Texas than anywhere else? I don't know. I'm curious. I mean, the numbers were all, like the real people that got sick are the people with comorbidities. That was the real issue. What it exposed is metabolic health. And it's not that it didn't exist. It did because I have a brother-in-law who was in New Orleans in the epicenter of it. And it was the beginning of his residency and all that. And he was like, oh, bro. Oh, it fucking existed. I mean, it was fucking gnarly. Yeah. If you're really unhealthy, COVID fucked you up. Fucked you up. If you're really fat in particular, there was something about the way it reacted with fat people. African-Americans too. He said. That's a vitamin D thing. That's a vitamin D thing. Yeah. Well, you know, African Americans, the reason why they're so dark, the melanin is to protect them from the sun and melanin in white people. The reason why they're so pale is because it acts as like a fucking solar panel for vitamin D. Right. So the melanin actually protects them from the sun's damage. And, but it also makes it more difficult for them to get vitamin D. So my friend did his residency in New York, and he said during the wintertime, we would do blood panels on people, and they would have undetectable levels of vitamin D. And this is the reason why people get sick in the winter. You're covering up, you're indoors most of the time, you're not getting any vitamin D, you're not getting any sun. If you're not supplementing, and not just with vitamin D, by the way, you have to mix vitamin D with K2 and magnesium. That's the most effective way for your body to process it. If you're not doing that, your immune system is shit. It's not that you're giving, you're not a living petri dish and you're giving each other the thing because you would do that in the summer too, but the minute you go outside and you get that vitamin D and you get that sun, it's burning it away. Yeah, well, you're out in the sun. You're healthier. You're supposed to be outside. We're not designed to be locked up in fucking Right. health is going to suffer. If you're not fit, if you're not healthy, if you're overweight, if you're not eating well, if you're not taking vitamins, all those things are a huge factor that was completely ignored. And the narrative was like, no, you need this novel injection that we haven't tested on anybody. We're going to fucking shoot it in every baby, every kid, every pregnant woman. Did you ever take one? No, I almost did. I didn't think it was a bad thing. This whole pandemic is through education and talking to doctors and also through my experiences, it completely changed my concept and my thought about the medical system. When the vaccine was first available, I was more than willing to get it. In fact, the UFC allocated like 150 vaccines for all their employees. And we were doing these COVID shows where there was no audience. So we would do it at the Apex in Vegas where the UFC has their own small arena. And we'd have the fights there and you'd go and get tested. I would get tested in Austin. I'd fly to Vegas and then they'd test me again and you weren't supposed to go anywhere. You just stayed in your hotel and then you showed up and did the fights. And then they got the allocations for the vaccine and I called up the doctor and I said, hey, I'm here for the fights. Can I get vaccinated? They said, sure, come on in. And then when I got there, I called the doctor and said, actually, you have to go to the clinic. We have to do it at the clinic. Can you go on Monday? And I said, I can't. I have to go back to Austin, but I'll be back in two weeks for the next fights and we'll do it then. He said, great. In that two weeks, they pulled the vaccine because people were getting blood clots. And then also during that two weeks, two people that I knew had strokes. Like one guy was in his 50s and one guy was in his 40s. Immediately following the vaccination? Within days of the vaccine. Within days. It would stop beating for like nine seconds at a time. Wow. And he would just faint and he was falling down. Right. And, you know, Dr. Drew's talked about this, about he believes that's what happened to a lot of people that got boosted. A lot of people like after the booster, like there's something that would happen where your heart would just stop beating for a while and you'd black out and it would start up again. Because it wasn't proven. It wasn't a proven thing. But then again, how many of them are proven? Because you said, what, 72, 73 shots? Yeah, well, that's a different kind of vaccine. No, but I understand that. But there's still vaccines. And you go, why so much more now? Is there that much more disease? It's money. I think it's money. It's all based on money. I mean, I'm not an anti-vaccine person, but I subscribe to Robert F. Kennedy's perspective. They should all be tested. They should be safety tested, and they're not. But it comes down to this thing, like we were talking about working out. It comes down to this thing where you go, listen, the medical community I can use for certain things. The holistic community I can use for certain things. Why do I have to deny one just to be full in on the other? Right, Right. Exactly. Well, it's just a narrative that they put out there that medicine and pharmaceutical drugs are the most important thing and everything else is bullshit. Everybody should take Oxycontin. Everybody should be on at least 10 Oxycontin a day. Yeah, it'll help you feel better. You'll feel better. You're just like, oh, I feel better. Yeah, and you don't have to do anything. You don't have to feel bad about it. So when we came here, that was the thing, was like everybody who came here was kind of like, fuck this. And then there were so many of us that Ron talked me into opening up a comedy club. You opened your own. Yeah, Ron went on stage for the first time in months. I think it was eight months. And he grabbed me by the shoulders like right after God I mean he fucking crushed he goes on stage as his giant standing ovation he crushes and he comes off stage he grabs me by my shoulder whatever the fuck we have to do we're gonna keep doing this he goes you gotta open up a club I go okay I'm gonna open up a club yes. And then I just started looking at club spots. How often do you do it? Almost, I mean, every week. Every week you're up there? I went on last night three times. I did three sets last night. Wow. Yeah. That's cool. I'm constantly working. Yeah. Do you know Robert Rodriguez? The director? Yeah. No, I don't know him personally. I'm aware of him though. That surprises me. Yeah. That's who I'm doing. I'm at the Paramount Theater tonight. I love that guy. Yeah, I love him. I've known him for 30 years. Oh, I'd love to meet him. Yeah. But no, I love his work, though. Yeah, super good guy. Yeah. And he plays at Antoine's a lot. Oh, yeah, Antoine's. Antoine's. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's Gary Clark Jr.'s place. Is it? Yeah, it's my friend Gary. I didn't know. So my wife knows Gary's wife really well. Oh, my wife knows Gary's wife really well. Oh, shit, dude. I met somebody on the plane who sat next to me, so I flew from New York. Yes, they sent a picture to my wife. No. Yes, yes. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Bentley? I don't know the guy's name. I don't know the guy. No, no, no, no, no. The guy that I met on the plane today, he said, what are you here doing? I said, oh, I'm going to see Brogan this afternoon. I'm doing Paramount Theater tonight. And he said, oh, that's so funny. And he didn't talk to me the whole flight. And he said, my son Bentley went out with Rosie. Yes, that's what it is. For a year. Yes, that's what it is. So he sent a photograph to my wife. Yeah. Because I took a photograph with him that he sent to his when I was leaving my wife shows me the photograph and funny. It's crazy. That's great small world Yeah, super super small world. Yeah, but yeah, so yeah Gary's wife and my wife are good friends. Yeah, so never met Gary. Oh, he's the best man I love him. He's the best. I mean, that's another real artist true. That's That's an artist. I mean, he's an artist. Another true artist. I was just with him. I did his video. I was asked to do a lot of videos and I've never done a video because I've never wanted to do a video. The idea of doing video seems weird to me. You're like, you know, singing somebody else's song or something like that. But Chris Stapleton, who's been a friend for a long time. So we were in Marfa together. Has he? Yeah. I love that guy. One of the greatest fucking guys. He and Morgan. One of the greatest people. So yeah, we were together over the weekend in Marfa, Texas. Oh, that's fucking cool. Yeah, it was awesome. Yeah. And Gary's another guy that I knew back in L.A. I met Gary at the comedy store. Doesn't he still live in L.A.? No, he lives here. Oh, he does? Full time? Yep. And that's the same thing. Like, when I talk to Gary about it, I go, why'd you move to Texas? And this was back when I was still living in L.A. He goes, man, fuck that. Right. Fuck that place. Fuck everything about that place. I don't like it. I told you. I don't feel good there. We just moved out of, we haven't moved to Austin. I've spent a lot of time here. I love it here. My mom's from Corpus Christi. I've spent a lot of time in Texas. I'm going to eat Whataburger while I'm here. But we moved to Santa Barbara recently, and it's one of those things. It's just like the thing about L.A. when you don't need because you can do so many things remotely, and you go, why am I here? Right. Right. Why am I here? Like I embrace this staunch thing of I'm a Californian and I loved going to New York and seeing how proud people were in New York. And I'd go back to California and I'd say, I want to be the one proud person that's in California. There was proud people in L.A. for a while. There were. We were all proud that we were L.A. comics. Yeah. L.A. comics were like a different thing than New York comics. Right. Because New York comics were all like for themselves. They were all kind of shitty and backstabbing and at the Comedy Store. We had a real community It was like and that's the best thing and what you've done is recreate it like even when I talk about a chopper community That's what it is. It's a community that you can rely on Yes, regardless of belief system or anything like that you go, but that guy has my back Yes, that guy will walk through fire from Yes. That guy wants me to do well. That's your people. That's my people. Yeah. And that's the same thing with that. All my people moved out here. They moved out here with me. So we had like 16 top shelf comedians move out here in the first two years. That many? There's so many clubs out here. There's five clubs on the street where my clubs are. That's crazy. I bought the old Ritz Theater. Yeah. So that's the comedy mothership now. And down the street, there's a Sunset Club that my friend Brian owns. And that's a club that's like five doors down from me. So all these are new clubs that's happened in the last four years. The Vulcan was already there. That was the club that we started working at when we came here. That's down the street from me. That's only like a block away. And then there's the Creek in the Cave, another comedy club that's only like two blocks away. There's a bunch of them just on this one street. What if I move here and open a club and just do monologues? Do you think people will come? Sure. If it's good. Ladies and gentlemen, this one's from Sicario. If it's good, people would go. They might. They might. Look, man. You fucking really have a passion for something. This is the weird artsy city, which I love. It's a great artsy city. It is. It is. There's a lot of fake artists. I know there are, but there is everywhere. Yeah. There's a lot of posers. Yeah. But that's all people that just like the idea of them being the one who decides what's real and what's not real. Yeah. Yeah. Just goofs. You're always going to have that. There's a lot of that. They hated us when we came here. But really what they didn't like is that you couldn't just fuck around anymore. The real killers were here now. The real top shelf, like national headliners, guys like Tom Segura and Tim Dillon and these animals moved into town. So this is like a new hub. It's the hub of the world for comedy. The Comedy Mothership is the hub of comedy in the world. That's wild. Yeah. I didn't know that. And it just opened two years ago. That's cool. It's packed every night. It's awesome. Like Dave came down like opening week. It was incredible. And no one knew he was there. So I did a set. And then after I did a set, I introduced him. And everybody just went fucking ape shit. And we were like, it's up. Like the club's rolling now. Now it's really happening. And then all these people were coming in from all over the country and a bunch of people moved here. And there's people moving here constantly. Shane Gillis moved here and all these guys moved here. So it's still happening. Oh, yeah. It's still growing. People are still coming, migrating in droves. We're talking about opening up another club because we're so packed every night and we have so many comics. We almost have too many comics and not enough room. Has the place grown a lot in the last four years? The city? Yeah, but do you see a gentrification of it or just like things that you go, no. You see a lot of tech bros have moved here because, you know, Google moved here and Facebook and Tesla. I remember when Jesse James moved here, which was a while ago. He moved here a long time ago. A long time ago. Yeah. I he moved from Long Beach. And he called me and he was like, it's fucking great here. It's fucking great. It's better. I just never will live in a place that has traffic ever again. I'll never live in a big city. Austin's like a million people. There's a million on the outside and a million in the city. It's nothing. It's easy. It's easy to get around. People are friendly. They're just like real people. There's no one here that's like connected to that machine that forced compliance. Why do you think that feeds into your, or like to me being in LA when everybody's talking about what's your status right now? The thing about here is all people care about is are you killing? Are you going on stage and fucking killing? Are you doing your best work? Are you doing it, period? Are you doing your best work? Like, do you care? Do you give a shit? Yes, do you really care? Are you really working on it? Are you really- Are you just another affectation? And if you're at that club, you have to be working on it because there's too many people that are working on it. There's too many killers. You can't just be lazy. You won't survive. There's too many killers. I want to go to this club. Anytime. Go tonight. Cool. If you want to come tonight. Well, I got this thing to do tonight. When's your thing? What time is it? I don't know. Eight? Seven? We have a 7 o'clock show and a 10 o'clock show. Really? Maybe I'll come afterwards. Come after. Come hang out. Jelly Roll was there last night. Really? Was he really? Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's cool. Jelly Roll's the man. He's here all the time. He's always hanging out here. Do you have my book? I do not. You don't? No, I do not. No one sent it to me. If they did, it probably went to a publicist or someone. I was going to bring a book for you. I'll buy it. Josh Brolin from Under the Truck. Why from Under the Truck? What do you think? Because that's where you were drunk, passed out? That's where my mom's boyfriend was drunk and passed out. But it has this, to me, I chose it because it has a double entendre that when you're under a truck, you're either fixing it or getting run over by it. Hence my life. I'm either getting run over by it or fixing it. How did you sort it out? Because you're so together now. Am I? Yeah, I think you are. Thank you. You're fun. Thanks, man. Fun people are together. If you can be fun, you're together. I think I'm at that place. I found a place that you have always been at that I didn't have. I had the opposite where you go, no, I didn't do cocaine because, and forget the drugs. It's the mentality. I didn't do cocaine because it would kill me. And I would go, oh, that stuff will kill you. Yeah. You like juicy stuff. I do. And I want to read you juicy stuff. 13 LSD is so wild. That's such a crazy, mind-blowing experience for a 13-year-old to have. Yeah. Can you at i mean i had i had kids when i had my first kid i was 20 years old and i was looking at 14 years in prison oh my god yeah so jesus christ so i that's why i didn't i would i missed my shot out there i was surprised it's johnny cash there's we going to order it. Find Josh Brolin's. Oh, yeah. See if it's in there. I think there's a couple. Get a big mental print of it. Not that I'm proud of it. Well, it's part of your life and it's why you're you today because you've gone through shitty experiences. Yeah, but I don't know if they're shitty. That's what I haven't decided whether they're shitty or whether they're necessary for this person to get to this place And not everybody gets to that place. So we're talking about all these people like Hunter S Thompson Hunter S Thompson is my mother man Just did she wasn't a good writer But everything that youth the song right? That was my mom My mom had a not loaded 9-millimeter at her bedside table all the time. She was part of the, what was the scam that went on in the 80s? The pyramid scam. Oh. Remember that? She was one of the top five winners of the pyramid scam. Oh, boy. She could talk anybody into anything. So she would come home literally, man, with bags, with grocery bags full of cash. Wow. And she'd dump it out and she'd say, count. Jesus. So I would sit there and count. Wow. Jesus. Wow. Oh, wow. it and bought some drums when my grandmother died we found stuff like that in her house because my grandmother went through the depression oh yeah and so everybody they all like stockpiled money so she had coffee cans yeah filled with money that she had like tucked away in like different areas of the house that we found after she died right right that's kind of great yeah the mentality of like yeah well the the mentality you grow up or you literally might starve to death there's no and you because there's no way that can't affect you And that's the whole point no way there's no way that somebody can have that mentality of every cent means something right and we have to hide it unless Somebody else takes it or whatever with my mother. It was always looking for the most vivid experience And I don't know why that was her parents weren't like that. It's just how she was And you either have my brother I don't know if you have siblings or not but my brother dealt with it totally different my brother imploded so he lives his life as simply as you can possibly live it whereas me it was my reaction was the other way yeah yeah yeah so so how now and why I don't know I don't know. 45 years old. It feels like a good age to go, okay, do I want to go Nick Nolte or do I want to go? Right, right, right, right. And I can do that. Easy. Nick used to date Vicky Lewis, who was on news radio with me. No way. Yeah, yeah. I didn't know that. Yeah remember Vicky. Wow. Super talented. Super talented. Could sing, could act. She was a firebrand. Yeah. And Nick used to hang around the set and it was always so weird to me to be talking to Nick Nolte. It was so strange. Yeah. I remember one time I went to Fry's Electronics because I was going to buy some, I I used to make my own computers because I was really into computer games. So I'd build my own computers. And so I'm there looking at motherships, and I see this fucking old guy with his glasses on. And I go, Nick goes, oh, hey, Joe. How are you, man? Do you know anything about these things? And I was talking to him about computer stuff, but I just couldn't believe he knows my name and he remembered me. He saved my life, man. He saved my life at 25. Bro, there's a terrible movie called Warrior. It's a terrible movie. Terrible movie. You mean the UFC movie with Tom Hardy? That movie sucks. But he's fucking incredible in it. He's amazing. His one scene, this one scene where he breaks down, you know, he's the dad. It's so fucking good. It's so good. That one scene is worth sitting through the entire preposterous movie. Yeah. Why do you hate that movie so much? Because it's fake. You can't fight like two days in a row. Wasn't the Tyson-Jake fight, wasn't that amazing? Yeah. It was amazing they got paid so much money for that. $25 million and $40 million? I think $20 and $40. Yeah, I think that's what I'd heard. You know, which I'm happy Mike got the money, and I'm happy that he didn't get hurt. That was my fear that it was going to be a real fight and he was going to get hurt. You've known him for a long time. I've known him for a long time. I love that dude. Me too. And he was a like larger than life figure in my childhood. Truly. When I was a kid, when he was a champ, it was like, people don't understand what a champ he was. Like he was a, he wasn't just the heavyweight champ of the world. He was an executioner. Like you, every fight was just a matter of how long was it going to last? I don't remember which fight it was that I went to go see a couple of fights. And I actually went to go see Julio Cesar Chavez fight. And that's when I met Tyson in the green room. And I met at the same time Muhammad Ali in the green room. Oh, wow. That was a moment. Wow. As a boxing fan, that was a real moment. But I remember, and I don't know who it was, and I think it was a 90-second fight, and I went to go see this fight, and Tyson was fighting, and this guy was doing this stuff. And he had this cut. He had built himself into confidence. And Mike came out afterwards. He was the first one, obviously. And Mike came out afterwards, and I watched his face. I didn't watch Mike. You would normally watch Mike because he Mike because he's so charismatic and he's coming you want to see what he's going to do and I watched the guy's face and I watched that confidence bleed from his face yeah instantaneously yeah he had absolutely lost the fight long before Mike had ever gotten in the ring yeah I maintained that in the time where he was champion like the two or three years where he was at his best, he was the greatest fighter of all time. Of all time. Of all time. That's why it was so interesting to me as I was watching it, and I'm very verbal when it comes to that shit. Come on! What the fuck? You know what I mean? And he was, he's still quick. Oh, yeah. He's still quick. He's still very quick. And he would do these things. But, you know, Mike had, like, he was walking with a cane just like a year and a half ago. Yeah, but he was really out of shape. He had bad sciatica. Bad sciatica. Yeah. I didn't know that. Yeah, real bad. It wasn't that long ago that he was, you know, I mean, when I first met him, he was very, very heavy. He was not working out at all. And I asked him, how come you don't work out? He goes, I don't want to ignite my ego. He goes, I don't want to ignite the gods of war. The gods of war. Yeah. And then the second time he came in was when he was preparing for the Roy Jones Jr. fight. Came in here? Yeah. And he was a totally different human being. He was fucking jacked and in shape. And he looked super intense. And he was just like ready to go. And it was terrifying. It Jamie when was this a few years ago four years ago four years ago and so when he came in the second time I was like this is Jamie said it afterwards he's like that's a totally different human being than the first time we saw him he was one of the first guys like like I said with Nick Nolte he was like is that really Nick Nolte this is crazy I can't believe he's there. Mike Tyson was one of the first people that I met that I can't believe he's really here. Because he was so iconic. You had to be alive and be a kid during the time where he was the champion to understand what he was. Because there was, after Muhammad Ali, Larry Holmes was a great fighter, but no one liked him because he beat up Muhammad Ali. So people always just wanted him to lose. Yeah, but is that the only reason? There's just a certain air of somebody, and they come along once in a great while. Yes, but Larry Holmes never got his due. He was an amazing fighter. Amazing fighter, but still. But when he retired, then there was just like a series of boring champions. Like no one cared about the heavyweight division at all. No one cared. And then the cover of Sports Illustrated, I have it framed in my office at home. It said Kid Dynamite on it. And he was 19 years old. And I was like, who is this guy? And then I started watching him fight. And then he was fighting on like ABC, Wide World of Sports. You're like, Jesus Christ. Do you find yourself going back and watching highlights just to do it? Oh, yeah. I do it all the time. I watch Tyson fights all the time. Yeah. Yeah. I just watched his fight with Frank Bruno just a couple of days ago. Frank Bruno. Oh, my God. Tyson was something. I just don't think you can maintain that. You can only do that for a few years. The only fights that never worked out were like, do you remember the fight with him and Bone Crusher Smith? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Not a great fight. No. It wasn't the best fight. Because Bone Crusher Smith was not a great fighter. Well, he was a good fighter. But not a great fighter. He's just a tough guy. But, you know, brutal knockout puncher. It just wasn't at Mike's level. Mike was at a level that no one was at. It was an insane combination of discipline, talent, incredible coaching, psychology. You know, when he was 13 years old, he was adopted by a guy who was a hypnotist. Cus used to hypnotize him. Oh, I didn't know that. Yeah, he hypnotized him by the time he was 13. Into being the greatest fighter? Into being the greatest fighter. Wow. And he told him, you don't exist. Only the task exists. And the task was just destruction. Did Mike tell you that? Yeah. I've never heard him say that. Did he say that to other people? Oh, yeah. He said it publicly. He talked about it. Yeah, he talked about the hypnosis. The hypnosis. He started doing it when he was 13 years old. So what's the parallel between, and this is the last thing I'll interview you about. What's the thing between Tyson and John Jones, Who I met once and I looked at him when I met him on a plane and he didn't give me really the time of day But I was like, I'm a huge fan and I don't say that often to a lot of people. He probably gets out all day long I'm sure he does. Yeah, it's no doubt Special fighter it's conquerors. That's what it is. Like they're both conquerors like I had this thing that I put up on my Instagram the other day that somebody made. It was me talking about trying to explain why John exists, that there's people that are just different. They're wired different, and they are uncommon amongst uncommon men. They rise to the top of the top. They're the black op of their portion. They just dominate, and that's John. He's just the greatest of all time he's 37 years old and he's still the greatest i mean watching that fight watching watching you know tyson or jake paul or whatever jake paul i wouldn't even want to say tyson and then going the next day and watching that fight watching those fights it wasn't the only fight the one one before was what was his name? The fight before John Jones. Oh, Charles Oliveira and Michael Chandler. Oliveira. Yeah. Incredible fight. Incredible fight. Amazing fight. Yeah. Yeah, John is a special dude. When he's gone, we're all going to miss him. He's a different kind of guy. I mean, he's been at the top for 14 fucking years. He won the title as the youngest guy to ever win a UFC title. 23. And Mike was the youngest heavyweight champion of all time at 20, which is really crazy. Crazy. But when Jon Jones won that title at 23, it's just been destruction of everyone ever since. Never ducked anybody, fought all the best, destroyed everybody, dominated his division, went up to heavyweight, dominates at heavyweight. So why does somebody like that self-destruct? Is that a self-destruction? Because he's a wild motherfucker. That's how you get to be that good. Isn't that what we're talking about the whole time? Whether it's Hunter S. Thompson and this and how you walk that line. Mike Tyson spending whatever, $350, $400 million, going to jail, whatever that is. is wild but that's also what makes you so good that wildness John Jones when he fought Mauricio Shogun Hua for the light heavyweight title when he was 23 years old he opens up the fight with a flying knee nobody does that you're fighting a legend Shogun at that time when he was the light heavyweight champion he was a legend yeah and not just a legend from the UFC but a legend from pride yeah pride was this gigantic organization in Japan that Shogun, at that time, when he was the light heavyweight champion, he was a legend. And not just a legend from the UFC, but a legend from Pride. Pride was this gigantic organization in Japan that Shogun really became famous. So he was like a mythical creature, almost, in MMA circles. That was Shogun Hua. He was a beast. Conor McGregor and Jon Jones. Jon's in a different category. It's a different thing. Yeah. Conor self-destructed, you know, in a lot of ways because of money. You know, I mean, he took that fight with Floyd Mayweather, made a ton of money off that, and then took a long time before he came back to MMA. And it's just not been the same guy since. And I think that's just, it's money. it's a lot of partying, but it's the same kind of thing. It's just a wild, but in his prime, when Connor was in his prime, he was a fucking assassin. He was a fucking assassin. But it's that thing, that through line of not being able to let go. It's like what you were talking about, Chappelle. Chappelle leaves for 10 years, but then he goes to the park and he does a thing. There a thing that's insatiable that warrior mentality yeah but there's a difference because physically you can only fight for so long true comedy you get better every year you keep doing Dave's better now than he was a year ago he'd be better two years you can still be Rodney Dangerfield right actually Don Rodney when I saw him was probably 70 years old he was murdering in his fucking bathrobe naked and with this schlong hanging out. Yeah, he was He was still amazing because it's not a physical thing You don't have like your body can only compete at the highest levels which is one of the things that's so extraordinary about John Yeah, he's 37. He still competes at the highest level. It blew my mind the other night Well, it was exciting, you know, it was nice to be excitedates passed his prime, unfortunately, and he's got a lot of wear on the tires. It was kind of rough watching him get beat up like that. But that's the game they play. That's the sport. Yeah, and what's great about UFC that I never thought would last in the beginning, the great thing is anything can happen. Anything can happen. We always did that, but then they started putting cameras on us. Right. And I don't know why, when they started doing that. Yeah. We always did that. Every time something would happen, we would throw our- Because it's organic. Yes. It's like you can't help it. That's what I'm doing at home. Yeah. Holy fuck. Holy shit. Yeah. Holy shit. Holy shit. Yeah. There's moments where you just like, you can't believe it's really happening. Yeah. That's the sport. The sport is, it's the craziest sport. It's the highest consequences of any sport. It's so raw and dangerous, and you can't look away. It's so crazy. And when someone can dominate it, like Jon Jones or Georges St-Pierre or Mighty Mouse or any of the greats. Georges St-Pierre, another great one. Greats. When they can do that, it's like that's a different kind of human being this is I mean to be the best of the best people the best people in the world at fighting and then he's the best of the best people Yeah, and when George was in his prime, it was that same sort of thing You would see him stand there like this intense look in his eyes just couldn't wait to get his fucking hands on that guy like damn It's you I feel very very very very fortunate that I've been able to witness personally so many of those moments and be there to watch greatness so many times. I think it's great that you've continued. It's surprising to me. I love it. I know you do, and that's why you continue to do it. I did the first 13 of them for free. First 13 ever? Yeah, the first thing I did there was already it was like UFC 37 oh when you got into it I started working at UFC 12 I did UFC 12 was the first event that I did in 1997 I was the post fight interview guy and so I did that for a couple of years but it was banned from cable it was basically that's why I said it was going it, and then it was going down. Boxing did it to them. Boxing in cahoots with Budweiser, which is funny because now Bud White sponsors the UFC. Right, right. But they all wanted the MMA thing to go away. To go away. Because it was so exciting and crazy, they thought of it as a threat. Yeah. And they essentially banished it. It also just had this unsavory look to it. You're fighting in a cage. Yeah in those days, it was bare knuckle. It was bloody. Yeah, it was just crazy. They would call it human cockfighting, which I always found disgusting. But me, as a martial artist, the question was always, what would happen if you got a judo guy and he fought a wrestler? What would happen if you got a boxer and he fought a karate guy? And the UFC is like, let's find out. So Horry and Gracie came up with this concept. That's what I was going to say. Gracie was one of the first judo versus jiu-jitsu, right? Well, Hoist. Hoist was the first champion of the UFC. And he was the first guy to introduce that technique is more important than everything. Technique is more important than being big, more important than being strong. Because Hoist was like 175 pounds. He was very slight and long and just a jiu-jitsu wizard. And he would get guys on the ground and strangle the fuck out of them. And we were like, what happened? This is crazy. This big jack guy. Also, the big jack guy's tapping. You're like, what? What happened? And Hoist just opened up the world to Brazilian jiu-jitsu. And it made Brazilian jiu-jitsu the most popular, Holy shit moment. His brother Hickson, his brother Hoyler, and Horian, of course, because he created the UFC. They changed martial arts forever. More development and evolution of martial arts has taken place over the last 30 years than over the last 30,000 years. Wow. Yeah. Like, really, that's accurate. Yeah. Like, fighting is different. People really understand what works and what doesn't work now. And watching him was balletic. It was like a ballet. Yes. It was art. It was art. It's real martial arts. No. It wasn't that. His dad told him, don't hurt these people. Don't hurt them. You don't have to hurt them. Show them the art. Just submit them. Show them the art. Yeah. So like Hoist, when he got on top of people, he wasn't like elbowing them, the eyeballs. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He was just strangling folks. Just arm barring folks. Making them tap. Making them quit. That's wild making him quit and he did it to everybody and they were all like what the fuck just happened and everybody had to learn jiu jitsu it changed martial arts forever do your kids do jiu jitsu yeah my kids have done it yeah have done it yeah they don't do it anymore they do other stuff I don't push them no whatever they're in if they wanted to do it tomorrow they said I'm thinking about doing some kickboxing let do you want to go? But I don't believe in – everybody's different. I don't want them to follow my footsteps or anything stupid like that. I want you to be your own human being. What are you interested in? They're both interested in different things. My youngest is an artist. My other one is a phenomenal athlete. It's like I think that you should do what you want to do. And if you want to do that, I'll bring you. I'll'll teach you I'll help you but if you don't want to do that I don't want to push you let me be a good parent and celebrate what my kid is not what I want there's so many different kinds of things you could be interested in life and everyone has a different psychology so everyone has different things they gravitate towards it's just like what is the thing is it music is it art is it your writing what do you like to do find that thing chase it down how many kids do you have i have three i have a grown she's 28 and i have a 16 and a 14. yeah i feel like you've got to do what what what compels you what drives you and part of it as a parent is like there's so many stories of parents particularly with like talented athletes that were too hard on the kid and put too much discipline on the kid and the kids burned out yeah i've seen so many cases of that yeah you know with these sideline or that asian mentality you should not hear but they're the joy you know what hoist gracie's dad used to do if he lost a competition He would buy him a present Because what was the psychology they're always gonna want to win meeting the effort he bought the effort he bought the present for the effort It doesn't matter doesn't matter like here. You have a toy. Here's a here's a gift. Here's a thing like it's like this is just growth. It's just just development Hoist's dad Elio felt like you live the same life over and over and over again until you get it right you subscribe to that like ancient Eastern philosophy of reincarnation. Yeah, he really believed you live the same life over and over and until you get it right. Mm the way he's kids. Just do 1% better a day. Just do 1%. It's not about going from here to here. It's not living at 100% all the time. It's the process. It's the process. It's the process, the constant process of growth. Yeah. And through that constant process, I mean, what they did was even more crazy because Elio, along Carlos Gracie they revolutionized a martial art like they Jiu Jitsu is brought over by these judokas from Japan Maeda and Kimura who came over to America or came over to Brazil rather and trained with the Gracies and then they took those techniques and made them applicable to smaller people made them applicable to like, like, because Ilia was only 145 pounds. But he would have these no rules fights in Brazil. These fucking huge fights that would go for like an hour and a half. Wow. Yeah. And he would just beat these guys with technique. So they developed leverage. They figured out a way to highlight the submissions and make things super technical. And they would analyze moves and break them them down and it became the philosophy of the entire family. That one family created more fucking assassins than any other family in the history of martial arts. And yet they're the nicest people. The nicest people. Yeah. Yeah, I hoisted in here a couple months ago. He was awesome. He's so fun. You know Sessy? No. She's with Laird a lot. She's with Laird's place a lot. I mean, they have a clan, bro. It's a clan, but it's a close clan. Yes. And it's a friendly, familial clan. Yep. Yeah, they're very nice people. But that's the thing about jiu-jitsu. It's like you get out all your aggression in the gym, and it kills your ego. And you can go be kind. You can just be a nice person. Be a nice person. Jiu-jitsu people are some of the nicest people I've ever met. Me too. They're super friendly and warm and normal people. They just are obsessed with this one thing. Yeah. And through that thing, it's like a vehicle for developing your human potential because it's so difficult. And when you do a difficult thing, it makes the rest of life a lot easier because there's no way whatever you're experiencing during the day is going to be as difficult as someone on your back trying to strangle the blood out of your brain like literally trying to fucking choke the blood out of your head like there's there's no way there's no way life could be harder but that's the thing is the wildness you have to have something to be a champion to be a champion or to be a good person i think you haveness, which we've talked about throughout this whole thing. If you don't have wildness, you're going to be boring. Which if you bring it back, honestly, because I have to bring it back to the book, that's what the book is about. Yeah. Wildness unmitigated. Right. But you eventually figured out a way to get a grip on it. That eventually turns out on you. Yeah. No, but most people, it turns around and it bites you in the ass. Most people. And it's a sad ending. But I think those sad endings are a valuable lesson for the other people. Power of example. Yeah. You learn from a lot of, one of the reasons why I never did coke is when I was in high school, my friend's cousin became a coke head. He was a coke dealer and became a coke head. And him and his girlfriend would just do coke and hide. They were just like, they had an attic apartment. They were in this fucking apartment. They're just like doing coke and selling coke and watching TV. And he like withered away. He lost all this weight. Like he got bit by a vampire. Yeah. And I remember thinking, Jesus Christ, stay the fuck away from coke. It was terrifying. Why would you want to do that? What would be attractive about that? Nothing. I guess it's the, I mean, you've done it. I haven't done it. I guess it's the euphoria when you get that hit, that feeling, that feeling of elevation, you know, that feeling of like, you know, you just know fear and you feel excited. You want to start a business with people. You got plans. We're going to fucking take over. Like in the description of it, the eyes kind of get like this and the craziness. And you go, yeah, it's bad for everybody else. It may be good for you for like 15 minutes, but everybody else is fucking miserable around you. The worst thing to me was when I would be high, like smoking weed, and I'd be like just chilled and silly, and I'd run into a coke head. And you're like, oh, no. He's trying to talk to you like this? I'd just get battered with like talk. I'm like, I got to get out of here. It's disgusting to me. It's a weird drug. It's a weird drug, but it's obviously very popular. Yeah. And it causes a lot of problems. Yeah, no thanks anymore. Yeah. No thanks. I'm good. Not interested in that one. You smoke your butt. I'll smoke my cigar. Yeah, I like cigars too. Cigars are conversational. They are. They're tools're tools for conversation. They relax you, light your brain up a little bit, get you a little fired up. Read this book when you can. I will. Seriously, I think you'll like it. I know I'll like it. I like talking to you. Yeah, you'll laugh. You'll laugh. Not everybody will laugh when they read the book. You will laugh. Because I think you understand absurdity. How long did it take you to put it together two years? It's nonlinear. It goes all over the place in all these years Did you have when you sat down? Did you have like a framework in mind how you wanted to pursue it? No, no, no because I've written probably 90 journals my life 90 full journals and I would go back and I kind of started to put some of those together and I'd go, oh, that happened in 88 or that happened in 76. And that, you know, that kind of stands out as being a milestone moment or whatever. And I'd start to write those down. They were really poorly written. And then that started to instigate one thing and another thing. And it kind of wrote itself. I think it was 450 pages when I finished and then I knocked it down to like 240. What is that process like, the editing process? That's a good process. That's the hardest process I've ever gone through. But you become a better writer. Do you do it with an editor or do you do it by yourself? No, I did it with an editor because I didn't sell the book right away. First of all, most memoirs are not written by the people who they're about, about which makes no sense to me right because you're writing about yourself but you're hiring somebody else to do it but you're taking the money i don't get it so i wrote it i wrote the entire book then i sold it so i didn't sell it based on a celebrity i sold it based on the book because you could read the book and some people hated it some people read it and they go i don't get it it's too wild it's too whatever and well everything is not for everybody exactly and that's okay yeah that's not it's more than okay what's wild is when i when i when i was in the middle which i think you would like when i was in the middle of doing the audible for the book about halfway through stumbling through the audible i go what the fuck did I do I should burn any evidence that this fucking was ever even thought about and then I spiraled for about a month and I don't spiral I just don't spiral about everything anything I just I'm pretty cool with anything that you know comes along and then people started reading the book and then I got this varied response that was always visceral. It was never like, I really liked your book a lot. I thought it was well written and all that. Somebody would go, fuck. Yeah. And that's nice. That means you nailed it. I don't know. Yeah. I don't know. But I do know that the responses are good. Well, that's what's important. Yeah. It's working. It had a desired effect. You got out your thoughts. You got out your experiences. But that editing process is a good process because you refine and you clarify and you simplify. Yeah. That's cool. You get to look at it with fresh eyes. With fresh eyes. Yeah. You know, it's the arm bar. You could just grab an arm and then try to bend it as much as you can or you can fucking figure out how to get in there every time did you and tap the guy out did you always know that you're gonna do this you're gonna write this book no i'd written two or three books and put them in the corner in a dark corner and let them accumulate dust you know i've never i never thought i would do it publicly because i was always into that thing of like oh you're an actor and like get over it you want want to be a writer. You want to be a writer. You want to be a musician. Every actor wants to be a musician. Every actor wants to be a rock star. Yeah, exactly. And I was like, nah. And then this lady read this book, this lit agent. She said, I said it the third time and she said, you need to fucking stop saying, referencing yourself as an actor who's a writer. You're a fucking writer and a really good writer. Just write. And she was tough on me. So you feel like you had almost like a disclaimer? Like I'm an actor. Oh yeah, I did. That's what you're doing, giving yourself like an escape? I did because there was something about that profession anyway that I always looked at and I always thought, why do I do this? This is dumb. You know what I mean? And where's the self-importance come from? What happened to the wagon that just went down and people tried to shoot you? Doesn't the self-importance just come from attention? You get extraordinary amounts of attention and then people develop self-importance because of that. Because they think they deserve that attention. Because it's a false thing. And then you start seeing people manifest it like, excuse me, I said hot coffee. I didn't say warm coffee. I said, you know, and you go, I don't understand the mentality. That's the grossest. So for me, it's probably another attempt, which I think I've manifested in a bunch of different ways, of right-sizing. And there's nothing like that will right size you like a fucking book put you right back into why are you doing what you were doing where do you come from how do you feel about your kids where's your sensitivity where's your where things that have become concrete that you need to break in order to feel again? Where are you limiting yourself? And I don't like the idea of limiting myself. Did I love drinking? Fuck yeah. I had so much fun, dude. And so did a lot of other people. But I go, this is now limiting. Well, don't you want to go out and take a drink? I go, fuck no. When you're out with a bunch of people having fun? No, because I'm having fun. Right. You don't need to drink to have fun, but there's a thing when you're drinking a lot and having fun, you think this is the reason why I'm having fun. This is the reason why I'm having fun. Yeah. It's a trap. That's the trap. Yeah. That's the trap. Well, you know, you can have a drink or two and really enjoy yourself, or you could think that the only reason why you're enjoying yourself is because you're having a drink or two. And that's usually why you have more drinks, because you think, this is the reason people are liking me right now. This is the reason people think I'm funny. And you keep chasing that drive. Imagine if you went on stage, and every time you went on stage, you had to have at least six drinks. Because you go, this is what they want. And then you'd wake up in the morning and your kid goes and wakes you up and you're like, ah, fuck. You know, and you go, that's not worth it. What's the fucking dude's name from Knight Rider? You know who I'm talking about. Oh, David Hasselhoff? Yeah. You ever see that video? Of course I did. The kids. The burger video. Yeah. It's the saddest fucking thing ever. Yeah, it didn't look like a good burger. Well, he's just hammered and his kid filmed it. It's awful, man. Oh, it's so awful. It's so cringy. Yeah. That's what everybody's afraid of. Yeah. Becoming that pathetic example to your children. And you wonder how much that exists and the video's not going. That daughter videoed that. Right. Like, I want you to see what this what this looks like right and supposedly that kind of threw him into sobriety or whatever i don't know if he's sober or not did he if i don't know i will hope he is if anything would throw you into sobriety your children filming you that's the lowest moment possible would do it for you yeah i didn't want to be filmed so i stopped early he. You got off at the right time. I did get filmed. The last time. Yeah? Yeah, it was super lame. I was at a, what do you call it, a Del Taco, and I tapped the cab in front of me accidentally when I was moving forward. And he got out and created a thing, and somebody filmed it from the back of the cab. Oh, wow. Yeah, and I look stupid. You can't fucking, you can't fucking drive. You don't have to fucking drive. You're like, oh, dude. Shh, quiet. Don't speak. Oh, no. Don't speak. There's nothing worse than being sober and seeing something when you're drunk. Oh, there's nothing. Oh, no, I'm so gross. Because your perception of it, why you were like, no, no man This is an honorable moment. You're saying I did something that I didn't do right and we need to hash this out When when the when the reality is is you're just kind of regurgitating bullshit. Yeah Also, you know how to like affect people with your words Yeah, you know how to express yourself in a dramatic way. You think you're gonna fucking get through this on top an actor mother Yeah, motherfucker this I'm going Shakespeare on you. You know, my favorite movie of yours is what no country for old men Why because it's so fucked up Cuz it's It's such a fucked up movie. Even the end, when it ends, you're like, what happened? That's the end? Yeah. It's like, that guy, what's his name, Javier? Bardem. God damn, that guy was a good psycho. He was so good. God damn. That movie was so, it was just so unusual and intense. And there was no feeling, and people ask this all the time, there was no feeling that it was a special movie. Really? Yeah. I told you I went back to Marfa, Texas for the first time in 18 years with Stapleton. And the guy running the bank is the first guy that Javier kills in the movie. This is the guy running the bank right now, Chip. Wow. And I talked to Chip. I have a picture of me and Chip. And I talked to Chip and I said, I said, fuck, you were the first guy. You know, did you think that? And he said, no, that was a friend of a friend who said that they were auditioning people. And the reason I did it is because I figured nobody would ever see it. It seemed like a small. No, that's the proprietor. It's the first guy that Javier killed outside. That was a good scene, though. What is that dude like in person, Javier? The best. The sweetest human being. One of my best friends. Crazy. Yeah. That's inside of him. Well, that's the thing. That's what makes him an artist. Yes, yes. Because he's one of these guys that literally, he was so depressed during that thing. Really? Oh, my God, dude. Because he didn't like doing it? No, he was like, look at my hair. What the fuck? You know what I mean? That's depressed him. Look at him. Oh, my God. He played such a good psychopath. He wore SPF 100. He had an umbrella all the time to keep the sun off him. You see how pale he looks? But yeah, that's the guy. The guy to the left, that's Chip. Can you stand there for a second, please? So he was really depressed because of his hair? Yeah, and me and Woody would take him out. We would take him out to the Cowgirl, what was it called? Cowgirl cafe. And we would have drinks with him. We would make him, because he would stay in his apartment with the drapes drawn and all this kind of shit. He just didn't want to go out. He said, I don't like violence. I don't drive. I don't know why they hired me. Why the fuck did they hire me? Like, why am I here? Well, how did he pull that out then? And I'm from Spain. Like, this guy's not from Spain. I remember when we worked, we sat in a trailer and he said, in that proprietor scene, he has this great line. He goes, call it. He takes the coin and goes like that. He says, call it. The guy says, I don't want to call it. He says, you have to call it. It's destiny calling for you. And we were in his trailer and Javier says, how do you say it? And I said, call it. And Javier kept saying, call it. And I said, no, dude, call it. Can you hear it? What's the most you ever lost in a coin toss? Sir? The most you ever lost in a coin toss. I don't know. I couldn't say. Call it. Call it, yes. For what? Just call it. Well, we need to know what we're calling it for here. You need to call it. I can't call it for you. It wouldn't be fair. I didn't put nothing up. Yes, you did. You've been putting it up your whole life. You just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin? No. 1958. It's been traveling 22 years to get here. And now it's here. And it's either heads or tails. And you have to say it, call it. Look, I need to know what I stand to win. Everything. How's that? You stand to win everything, call it. All right. Heads, then? Well done. Don't put it in your pocket, sir. Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter. Where do you want me to put it? Anywhere not in your pocket. What'll get mixed in with the others and become ing a coin. Which it is. I mean, if you look at that from a different perspective, you say that scene could have been the worst scene ever. It's because of the simplicity of the scene. Plus the consequences. It's the pause. Bloom in the air. It just hangs. And you know that this guy has some sort of weird morals. It's so good, man. Yeah, he's got some code that he lives by. And he's about to impose this code on this guy. And has no problem putting that bolt through his brain. No problem. And the guy knows it and he doesn't even know why he knows it. It's just something. He just knows it. Yeah. And you sit there and you just kind of, it's a great scene, man. Yeah. How did you not know that movie was great while you were doing it? Because it was so, we were just. The Coen brothers are fucking amazing. They're amazing, but you were just having, they had done two movies that were sort of bigger than what they normally do. One was with Clooney and one was with Tom Hanks and it didn't work. Oh Brother Who Are Out There? No, the fucking Oh Brother Who Are Out There was amazing. It was amazing. It was Lady Killers and what was the one with Clooney? I've never heard of that. Well, there you go. Yeah. But they yeah so i think that they just went back to this simple like burn out no burn after reading was after no country which was also really good super good but yeah they just kind of went back to this very kind of feral you know base place and just said let's just tell this simple story and let's let it happen let's maybe I don't know I don't think they're like how did you not know why you were doing it though? Like this it just didn't have amazing scenes. It didn't have that vibe It was so simple wild was so simple and and but then the wild though into the what dude when I saw I saw it with my kid Which was probably super irresponsible. How was your kid 16? He was like, that's. He was like, that's on the cost. But I saw it with him in an editing room on a big screen and we left and we got in the car and we didn't talk for 15 minutes and that's never happened. Wow. Like literally not one word. Wow. And then I said, what do you think? And he goes, fuck. Which is a great response. That's that movie. That is that movie. That movie is fun. You know, you want to tie it together too in the end and like a typical Hollywood ending and Javier and my character go head to head at the end and that doesn't happen. So you do something, which is how it was written in the book, Cormac. And I got to know Cormac really well. I was with Cormac the night before he died. Oh, no kidding. Wow. That guy could fucking write. Fuck, dude. Some of the greatest writing, American writing ever in the history of this country. There was something about his writing. It was like, Jesus Christ. That's another one of those guys, artists, where you go. I would ask him about his writing. I didn't want to talk about it ever. And then finally he got mad at me one day, and he was like, I don't fucking know, man. I just sit down with the typewriter, and it comes. Like, what do you want me to tell you? Wow. I was like, all right, man. Fucking 87 years old. Relax. But he could write. I mean, he had some, he was tapped into, and talk about a guy who just like, you were like the muse and do you have a special place and do you have this thing that, no. Just sits down and writes. The bed that he was on, it was me, his ex-wife, his son, and Cormac that last night. Wow. Always at the edge of his bed was that typewriter that he used for 25, 30 years to write all those novels. And then he had one before that that was exactly the same. But that typewriter was on an old piece of wood at the foot of his bed. Wow. And even at the end, he would just grab that thing and get it out. It was cool. Yeah, there's rare humans like that that have that thing. Yeah. Yeah. They just tap into something. And they tap into it and they just keep going. They get on that path and they just keep going. It just keeps getting better. They just get better at it. We've talked about a series of very special people. You know, what's the difference of what makes somebody that special, that iconic? Are they crazy? They're definitely different. They're different. Yeah. I mean, it's a resistance to the norm. It's, it's acceptance of reality. It's a poetic understanding of our place in the universe. There's so many different things that are all sort of coalescing into this expression. But they see through a different lens, though. They're just made up of a different cellular makeup. That's probably why he didn't want to talk about it. He didn't want to fuck it up. He didn't want to fuck it up. He didn't want to mitigate it. He didn't want to lessen it. He didn't want to, what's the word, make it pedestrian. Yes. You know what I mean? Yes. He didn't want to try. Sometimes magic is just magic. You don't want to figure out how it's happening. Just know that you can do it and just keep doing it. Exactly. Just be a craftsman. Be a person who's dedicated to this thing. Yeah, you know, yeah He has to know he had to know it was really good. I mean enough people told him it was really good Yeah, but if you have even a guy like that who wrote the first up until all the pretty horses none of his books sold That's pretty crazy like a thousand people bought it 1500 people bought it and then it was made into a movie. And then you go back and you're like, all these banned books that we know back in the day, 1984, George Orwell, Henry Miller, all these fucking people. People are like, ew. And then Van Gogh, painting a painting, and all those paintings being outside getting rained on. And now they're for a hundred million dollars. Yeah. All after he's dead. All after he's dead. Yeah. He never knew he sold one painting in his lifetime. So he never got to not even a little bit experience what, Oh, look at what you did. Right. Wow, man. Well, maybe that's why they're so good. Because they have to do it anyway. Because it's like a purity of expression. Yeah, he's just doing it. Whether people paid attention or not, it's who they were. And they gave themselves to it. Yeah. A thousand percent. He's an artist. An artist. A real artist. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks, dude. Thank you. It was a lot of fun. Really appreciate it. I really appreciate it. I'm going to read your book immediately. I would like you to. I will definitely. You're one guy I would really like for you to read. I'll get on it. Okay. All right. Thank you. Thank you very much. Bye, everybody. Bye.\n"
